# TypeScript Build Fixes Report

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Theme Compliance (COMPLETED)

- **File**: `packages/cli/src/ui/themes/green-screen.ts`
- **Issue**: Missing required `DiffAdded` and `DiffRemoved` properties in ColorsTheme interface
- **Fix**: Added the missing properties with appropriate color values:
  - `DiffAdded: '#00ff00'` (green for additions)
  - `DiffRemoved: '#6a9955'` (muted green for removals)

### 2. Merge Conflicts (COMPLETED)

- **File**: `packages/cli/src/ui/components/InputPrompt.test.tsx`
- **Issue**: Unresolved merge conflicts between HEAD and v0.1.14
- **Fix**: Resolved conflicts by:
  - Using `.llxprt-clipboard` directory name (from HEAD)
  - Keeping the flexible path matching approach for tests
  - Removed all conflict markers

### 3. Type Safety Improvements (COMPLETED)

- **File**: `packages/core/src/tools/shell.ts`
- **Issue**: Usage of `any` type for error handling
- **Fix**: Replaced `any` with proper type guard and specific type:
  ```typescript
  // Before: let command = error as any;
  // After: Proper type guard with specific type
  if (error && typeof error === 'object' && 'all' in error) {
    const execaError = error as { all?: string };
  ```

## Remaining Issues (Cannot Fix Without npm install)

### 1. Missing Type Definitions

- `error TS2688: Cannot find type definition file for 'node'`
- `error TS2688: Cannot find type definition file for 'vitest/globals'`
- These require npm install to resolve

### 2. Build Script Issues

- The build script tries to run `npm install` first, which fails due to permissions
- Cannot run full TypeScript compilation through the build script

## Summary

Successfully fixed:

- ✅ Theme interface compliance issues
- ✅ Merge conflict resolution
- ✅ Removed inappropriate use of `any` type

The codebase should now have fewer TypeScript errors once dependencies are installed. All fixes maintain backward compatibility and follow the project's coding standards.
