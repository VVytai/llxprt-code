# Cerebras Fix - Now Universal Defensive Measures

## What Changed

Made the Cerebras-specific fixes into universal defensive measures that apply to ALL providers. This protects against any provider that violates the OpenAI API specification.

## Key Changes

1. **Removed provider-specific checks**: The fixes no longer check if the provider is Cerebras
2. **Kept malformation detection**: Fixes only activate when they detect actually malformed data
3. **Two defensive fixes**:
   - **Streaming**: If a chunk has `message` but no `delta`, convert it to proper delta format
   - **Non-streaming**: If response is an array instead of single object, aggregate it

## Why This Is Better

- **Future-proof**: Protects against other providers with similar issues
- **Zero overhead**: Only activates when data is malformed
- **Backward compatible**: If Cerebras (or others) fix their API, the code still works
- **No performance impact**: Simple field checks are negligible

## Files Modified

- `/packages/core/src/providers/openai/OpenAIProvider.ts`:
  - Removed `isCerebras()` method (was unused after making fixes universal)
  - Changed "CEREBRAS FIX" comments to "DEFENSIVE FIX"
  - Removed Cerebras-specific checks from both streaming and non-streaming paths

- `/reports/cerebras.md`:
  - Updated documentation to reflect universal approach
  - Changed implementation status to completed

## Testing

- ✅ Build passes
- ✅ Lint passes
- ✅ Format passes
- ✅ All tests pass

## How It Works

The fixes are completely passive and only activate when they detect malformed data:

```typescript
// Streaming: Convert message to delta if delta is missing
if (chunk.choices?.[0]?.message && !chunk.choices[0].delta) {
  // Convert to proper format
}

// Non-streaming: Aggregate array responses
if (Array.isArray(data)) {
  // Aggregate into single response
}
```

This approach ensures maximum compatibility with minimal risk.
