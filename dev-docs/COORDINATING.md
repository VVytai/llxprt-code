# Subagent Coordination Guide

## CRITICAL: How to Execute Multi-Phase Plans

When you receive a plan with numbered phases, you MUST execute them sequentially. This document explains HOW to coordinate subagents to implement plans correctly.

## The Golden Rules

1. **NEVER SKIP PHASE NUMBERS** - If you have phases 03-16, you MUST execute: 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16
2. **ONE PHASE = ONE SUBAGENT** - Each phase gets exactly one subagent
3. **VERIFY BEFORE PROCEEDING** - Each verification must pass before the next phase
4. **NO COMBINING PHASES** - Phase 09-14 is NOT "one task" - it's 6 separate tasks

## Coordination Pattern

```
You (Coordinator) orchestrate like this:

Phase N Worker → Phase N Output → Phase N Verifier → PASS/FAIL
↓ (only if PASS)
Phase N+1 Worker → Phase N+1 Output → Phase N+1 Verifier → PASS/FAIL
↓ (only if PASS)
Phase N+2 Worker...
```

## Example: Executing a 16-Phase Plan

### WRONG WAY (What Happened with Emoji Filter):

```
❌ Phase 03 → Phase 04 → Phase 05 → Phase 06 → Phase 09 → Phase 11 → Phase 16
   (Skipped 07, 08, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15!)
```

### RIGHT WAY:

```
✅ Phase 03 (stub) → Verify 03
✅ Phase 04 (tests) → Verify 04
✅ Phase 05 (impl) → Verify 05
✅ Phase 06 (config stub) → Verify 06
✅ Phase 07 (config tests) → Verify 07  ← YOU SKIPPED THIS
✅ Phase 08 (config impl) → Verify 08   ← YOU SKIPPED THIS
✅ Phase 09 (stream stub) → Verify 09
✅ Phase 10 (stream tests) → Verify 10  ← YOU SKIPPED THIS
✅ Phase 11 (stream impl) → Verify 11
✅ Phase 12 (tool stub) → Verify 12     ← YOU SKIPPED THIS
✅ Phase 13 (tool tests) → Verify 13    ← YOU SKIPPED THIS
✅ Phase 14 (tool impl) → Verify 14     ← YOU SKIPPED THIS
✅ Phase 15 (integration) → Verify 15   ← YOU SKIPPED THIS
✅ Phase 16 (e2e tests) → Verify 16
```

## TodoWrite Usage for Plans

When starting a multi-phase plan:

```typescript
// IMMEDIATELY create todos for ALL phases
TodoWrite({
  todos: [
    { id: 'P03', content: 'Phase 03: Create stub', status: 'pending' },
    { id: 'P03-V', content: 'Phase 03 Verify', status: 'pending' },
    { id: 'P04', content: 'Phase 04: Write tests', status: 'pending' },
    { id: 'P04-V', content: 'Phase 04 Verify', status: 'pending' },
    { id: 'P05', content: 'Phase 05: Implement', status: 'pending' },
    { id: 'P05-V', content: 'Phase 05 Verify', status: 'pending' },
    // ... EVERY SINGLE PHASE MUST BE LISTED
  ],
});
```

## Subagent Launch Template

For EACH phase, launch subagents exactly like this:

```typescript
// Phase N Worker
Task({
  description: `Phase ${N}: ${shortDescription}`,
  prompt: `
    CONTEXT: You are implementing Phase ${N} of ${totalPhases}.
    
    PREREQUISITE CHECK:
    Verify Phase ${N - 1} was completed by checking for [specific artifacts].
    If Phase ${N - 1} artifacts are missing, return "ERROR: Phase ${N - 1} not complete"
    
    YOUR TASK:
    [Specific instructions for Phase N]
    
    DELIVERABLES:
    [Specific files/changes for Phase N]
    
    DO NOT:
    - Skip ahead to Phase ${N + 1}
    - Combine with other phases
    - Implement anything beyond Phase ${N} scope
  `,
  subagent_type: 'appropriate-type',
});

// WAIT FOR COMPLETION

// Phase N Verifier
Task({
  description: `Verify Phase ${N}`,
  prompt: `
    Verify Phase ${N} implementation is complete.
    
    CHECK:
    [Specific verification criteria for Phase N]
    
    RETURN:
    - PASS if all criteria met
    - FAIL with specific issues if not
  `,
  subagent_type: 'reviewer-type',
});

// ONLY IF PASS, proceed to Phase N+1
```

## Phase Skipping Detection

Before starting any phase after 03, ALWAYS check:

```bash
# Am I about to skip a phase?
Current Phase: ${N}
Last Completed: ${LAST}
If N != LAST + 1: ERROR - Cannot skip from Phase ${LAST} to Phase ${N}
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. "Efficient" Batching

❌ WRONG: "Let me do Phase 09-14 in one subagent since they're all tool integration"
✅ RIGHT: Launch 6 separate subagents for phases 09, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

### 2. Skipping "Obvious" Phases

❌ WRONG: "Phase 07 is just tests, I'll skip to Phase 08 implementation"
✅ RIGHT: Do Phase 07 (tests fail), then Phase 08 (make tests pass)

### 3. Jumping to "Important" Phases

❌ WRONG: "Phase 16 is integration tests, that's important, let me jump there"
✅ RIGHT: Complete phases 03-15 first, as they build the foundation for 16

### 4. Merging Verify Steps

❌ WRONG: "I'll verify phases 03-06 together at the end"
✅ RIGHT: Verify each phase immediately before proceeding to next

## Phase Dependencies

Many phases depend on previous phases:

- Phase 08 (config impl) NEEDS Phase 07 (config tests) to know what to implement
- Phase 11 (stream impl) NEEDS Phase 10 (stream tests) to verify correctness
- Phase 16 (integration) NEEDS Phases 03-15 to have something to integrate!

## Verification Must Be Atomic

Each verification is pass/fail for THAT PHASE ONLY:

```typescript
// WRONG
'Phases 03-06 look good overall';

// RIGHT
'Phase 03: PASS - Stub structure correct';
'Phase 04: PASS - 25 behavioral tests created';
'Phase 05: FAIL - 3 tests not passing';
'Phase 06: BLOCKED - Cannot proceed until Phase 05 passes';
```

## When to Stop

If any phase fails verification:

1. Do NOT proceed to the next phase
2. Either fix the current phase or report the blockage
3. Never skip ahead hoping to "come back later"

## Summary Checklist

- [ ] I have todos for EVERY phase number in the plan
- [ ] I am executing phases in numerical order
- [ ] Each phase gets one worker + one verifier subagent
- [ ] I wait for verification PASS before proceeding
- [ ] I never skip numbers (03→04→05, not 03→05)
- [ ] I never batch phases (09-14 is 6 phases, not 1)
- [ ] I check for previous phase completion before starting
- [ ] I stop if verification fails

Remember: The plan author numbered the phases for a reason. Respect the sequence.
