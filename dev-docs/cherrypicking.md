# Cherry-picking Guide for LLxprt Code

This guide documents the process for cherry-picking changes from the upstream gemini-cli repository while maintaining llxprt's multi-provider architecture and customizations.

## Overview

LLxprt Code is a fork of gemini-cli that adds multi-provider support (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) along with other enhancements. We regularly cherry-pick improvements from upstream while preserving our unique features.

## Process

### 1. Create a New Branch

**IMPORTANT**: Always work on a dedicated branch for cherry-picking. Never cherry-pick directly to main.

```bash
# Fetch latest from upstream
git fetch upstream

# Create a new branch from main
git checkout main
git checkout -b YYYYMMDD-gmerge  # e.g., 20250801-gmerge
```

### 2. Identify Commits to Cherry-pick

Review new commits from upstream:

```bash
# See what's new in upstream that we don't have
git log --oneline upstream/main ^HEAD

# Check how many commits behind we are
git rev-list --count HEAD..upstream/main

# See the last merge point with upstream
git log --oneline --merges --grep="Merge upstream" -1
```

### 3. Cherry-pick Relevant Commits

Cherry-pick commits one by one, starting from the oldest:

```bash
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

#### What to Cherry-pick:

- Bug fixes
- Performance improvements
- New features that don't conflict with multi-provider support
- Tool improvements
- UI/UX enhancements
- **IDE integration features** - llxprt has full IDE support, always cherry-pick IDE improvements
- Security fixes and permission improvements
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) improvements

#### What to Skip:

- `gemini-automated-issue-triage.yml` (GitHub workflow specific to gemini-cli)
- Changes that would break llxprt's multi-provider support
- Branding changes that would overwrite llxprt branding
- Auth changes that assume only Google auth (llxprt supports multiple providers)
- **Next-speaker check functionality** - This feature has been permanently disabled in llxprt and should never be re-enabled
- **Tool scheduler queue changes** - llxprt has superior parallel batching for multi-provider support
- **CLI argument removals** - Preserve backward compatibility unless there's a strong reason
- **ClearcutLogger (Google telemetry) commits** - All ClearcutLogger functionality has been completely removed from llxprt to prevent data collection
- Gemini-specific release commits

#### Features Reimplemented (Don't Cherry-pick):

These upstream features have been reimplemented in llxprt with our own approach:

- **Conversation Logging (commit `36f58a34`)** - Reimplemented as privacy-first, multi-provider conversation logging via `/logging` command with local storage, granular controls, and sensitive data redaction
- **Tool Scheduler Request Queue (commit `69322e12`)** - llxprt has superior parallel batching that queues and processes multiple requests in parallel for better multi-provider performance, while upstream processes serially

#### Features Completely Removed (Don't Cherry-pick):

These upstream features have been completely removed from llxprt for privacy/security reasons:

- **ClearcutLogger (Google telemetry)** - All Google telemetry collection has been completely removed from llxprt. The codebase now uses only local file logging for telemetry, with no data sent to Google servers. Any upstream commits that add ClearcutLogger functionality should be skipped entirely.
- **NextSpeakerChecker** - removed this as it wastes tokens and causes loops
- **FlashFallback** - presently disabled but slated to be removed - no one wants to auto fall back to flash to code with if they were using a better model.

#### Handling Conflicts:

When conflicts occur, preserve llxprt's:

- Multi-provider architecture (USE_PROVIDER instead of specific auth types)
- Import paths (`@vybestack/llxprt-code-core` instead of `@google/gemini-cli-core`)
- Branding and naming
- Extended authentication options

### 4. Fix TypeScript and Test Issues

After cherry-picking, you may encounter:

1. **TypeScript errors**: Often due to interface changes between llxprt and gemini-cli
   - Check error structures (llxprt may use different error handling)
   - Verify import paths are correct
   - Ensure provider-specific code is preserved

2. **Test failures**: Tests may expect gemini-cli behavior
   - Update test expectations to match llxprt's behavior
   - Preserve llxprt's multi-provider test scenarios
   - Fix mock objects to match llxprt's interfaces

### 5. Run Quality Checks

**IMPORTANT**: Always run these checks in order:

```bash
# 1. Run lint first
npm run lint

# 2. Run build to catch TypeScript errors
npm run build

# 3. Run tests
npm test

# 4. Run format AFTER everything passes
npm run format
```

### 5a. Batch Verification Phase (When Cherry-picking Multiple Commits)

When cherry-picking multiple commits, **verify after each batch of 5 commits**:

**Verification Process**:

1. After cherry-picking 5 commits (or fewer if it's the last batch)
2. Run full verification suite:
   ```bash
   # Full verification in order
   npm run lint
   npm run build
   npm test
   npm run format
   git add -A  # Stage formatted changes if any
   ```
3. Verify commits were actually applied:
   ```bash
   # Check that all expected commits are present
   git log --oneline -10  # Review recent commits
   git diff HEAD~5..HEAD --stat  # Check changes in last 5 commits
   ```
4. Fix any issues before proceeding to next batch
5. Create a fix commit if needed:
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "fix: resolve issues from batch N cherry-picks"
   ```

**Why Batch Verification?**

- Catches integration issues early
- Prevents accumulation of errors
- Ensures each batch is stable before proceeding
- Makes troubleshooting easier by isolating problematic commits

### 6. Commit Fixes

If you made fixes after cherry-picking:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "fix: resolve conflicts and test failures from cherry-picks

- <specific fixes made>
- <preserved llxprt features>"
```

### 7. Create Empty Merge Commit

To maintain parity with upstream's merge structure:

```bash
# Create an empty merge commit using -s ours strategy
# IMPORTANT: Merge the specific commit hash, NOT upstream/main
git merge -s ours --no-ff <last-cherry-picked-commit-hash> -m "Merge upstream gemini-cli up to commit <hash>

This is an empty merge commit to maintain parity with upstream structure.
All changes have already been cherry-picked:
- <list of cherry-picked features>

Maintains llxprt's multi-provider support, branding, and authentication
differences while staying in sync with upstream improvements."
```

**Critical**: Always merge the specific commit hash (e.g., `c795168e`), never merge `upstream/main`. This prevents bringing in all upstream commits again.

### 8. Push the Branch

```bash
git push origin YYYYMMDD-gmerge
```

### 9. Create Pull Request

Create a PR to main with:

- Summary of cherry-picked changes
- Any conflicts resolved
- Test results confirming everything works

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Auth-related Conflicts

Gemini-cli assumes Google-only auth, while llxprt supports multiple providers:

```typescript
// Gemini-cli pattern:
expect(refreshAuthMock).toHaveBeenCalledWith(AuthType.USE_GEMINI);

// LLxprt pattern:
expect(refreshAuthMock).toHaveBeenCalledWith(AuthType.USE_PROVIDER);
```

### Import Path Conflicts

Always use llxprt's package names:

```typescript
// Wrong:
import { Config } from '@google/gemini-cli-core';

// Correct:
import { Config } from '@vybestack/llxprt-code-core';
```

### Error Structure Changes

LLxprt may use different error structures:

```typescript
// Example: ToolCallResponseInfo
{
  error: Error; // Error object
  errorType: ToolErrorType; // Separate type field
}
```

## Important Notes

1. **Never merge directly to main** - Always use a PR
2. **Preserve llxprt's unique features** - Multi-provider support is core to llxprt
3. **Test thoroughly** - Especially provider switching and authentication flows
4. **Keep commits atomic** - One cherry-pick per commit for easy tracking
5. **Always verify code changes** - Don't just check commit messages; verify actual code was cherry-picked
6. **IDE features are important** - llxprt has full IDE integration, don't skip IDE-related commits
7. **Git history is the source of truth** - Use git commands to check sync status, not manual logs

## Merge Strategy

The `-s ours` merge strategy creates a merge commit without actually merging any content. This is used because:

1. We've already cherry-picked all desired changes
2. We want to maintain the same merge structure as upstream
3. It prevents accidental overwrites of llxprt customizations
4. It clearly marks our sync point with upstream

**Critical Detail**: When creating the merge commit, always specify the exact commit hash (not `upstream/main`). This ensures we only create a merge marker to that specific commit, not to the entire upstream branch.

This approach ensures we stay up-to-date with upstream improvements while maintaining llxprt's unique identity and features.
