# Phase 12 Completion - Logout Command Stub

## Phase ID
`PLAN-20250823-AUTHFIXES.P12`

## Completion Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - All requirements implemented and verified

## Implementation Summary

### Files Modified
- **`/packages/cli/src/auth/oauth-manager.ts`** - Added logout method stubs
- **`/packages/cli/src/ui/commands/authCommand.ts`** - Added logout action handling and method stub
- **`/packages/cli/src/auth/anthropic-oauth-provider.ts`** - Fixed TypeScript compilation error

### Implementation Details

1. **OAuth Manager Logout Methods**
   - Added `logout(providerName: string)` method stub that throws `NotYetImplemented`
   - Added `logoutAll()` method stub that throws `NotYetImplemented`
   - Both methods include proper plan and requirement markers
   - Methods are properly typed and documented

2. **Auth Command Logout Handling**
   - Updated `execute` method to recognize `logout` as valid action
   - Added `logoutProvider` private method stub that throws `NotYetImplemented`
   - Updated error message to include `logout` as valid action
   - Enhanced `showProviderStatus` to display token expiry information

3. **Token Expiry Display Enhancement**
   - Modified `showProviderStatus` to show token expiration time in minutes
   - Added proper plan and requirement markers for this enhancement
   - Displays format: "authenticated, expires in Xm"

4. **TypeScript Compilation Fix**
   - Removed unused `_currentToken` field from AnthropicOAuthProvider
   - Removed assignments to this unused field
   - All TypeScript errors resolved, compilation passes

## Verification Results

### TypeScript Compilation
✅ `npm run typecheck` - No errors
✅ `npm run build` - Successful build

### Plan Markers Verification
✅ Found 4 instances of `PLAN-20250823-AUTHFIXES.P12` markers
✅ Found appropriate `REQ-002` and `REQ-002.3` requirement markers

### Code Quality
✅ All methods properly typed with TypeScript
✅ No `TODO` comments added (as required)
✅ All stubs throw `NotYetImplemented` as specified
✅ Proper JSDoc documentation with plan markers

## Requirements Compliance
✅ **REQ-002** - Logout method stubs added to OAuth manager
✅ **REQ-002.3** - Auth command updated to handle logout action
✅ **Plan Specification** - All methods can throw `NotYetImplemented`
✅ **No TODO Comments** - All stubs use proper error throwing

## Plan Markers
All code includes proper plan markers:
- `@plan:PLAN-20250823-AUTHFIXES.P12`
- `@requirement:REQ-002` for OAuth manager methods
- `@requirement:REQ-002.3` for auth command methods

## Next Phase
Ready for **Phase 13** - `PLAN-20250823-AUTHFIXES.P13`

## Technical Notes
- Logout functionality is stubbed only, ready for future implementation
- Token expiry display enhances user experience
- TypeScript compilation maintained throughout implementation
- All existing functionality preserved
