# Task 19 – Results

## Task Summary
**Task Type:** Batch PICK
**Commit Count:** 5 commits
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

## Commits Cherry-picked

### Successfully Applied
1. ✅ `39e7213f` — Use port number for server port file instead of vscode pid
   - **Conflicts:** Yes - in ide-server.ts and ide-server.test.ts
   - **Resolution:** Preserved llxprt naming (`LLXPRT_CODE_IDE_SERVER_PORT` instead of `GEMINI_CLI_IDE_SERVER_PORT`, `llxprt-ide-server` instead of `gemini-ide-server` in file names)
   - **Test file:** Deleted ide-server.test.ts as it was removed in our branch

2. ✅ `4fd11139` — Allow builds to continue when sandbox detection fails
   - **Conflicts:** No
   - **Applied cleanly**

3. ✅ `5bac8556` — Require model for utility calls
   - **Conflicts:** Yes - in client.ts, client.test.ts, web-fetch.ts, web-search.ts
   - **Resolution:** 
     - client.ts: Made model parameter required, removed fallback logic
     - client.test.ts: Updated tests to pass model parameter
     - web-fetch.ts: Kept our multi-provider approach, skipped upstream's direct Gemini calls
     - web-search.ts: Kept our entire implementation as it's completely rewritten for multi-provider

4. ✅ `70938eda` — Support installing extensions with org/repo
   - **Conflicts:** No
   - **Applied cleanly**

5. ✅ `93820f83` — Remove Foldertrust Feature Flag
   - **Conflicts:** Yes - Multiple files affected
   - **Resolution:** 
     - Converted nested settings structure (`security.folderTrust.enabled`) to flat structure (`folderTrust`)
     - Updated all references to remove feature flag checks
     - Preserved llxprt's flat settings structure throughout

## Conflict Resolutions

### Commit 39e7213f (ide-server changes)
- **Files affected:** packages/vscode-ide-companion/src/ide-server.ts
- **Preserved llxprt customizations:**
  - Environment variables: `LLXPRT_CODE_IDE_SERVER_PORT` and `LLXPRT_CODE_IDE_WORKSPACE_PATH`
  - Port file naming: `llxprt-ide-server-${port}.json` instead of `gemini-ide-server-${port}.json`
  - Removed test file as it was deleted in our branch

### Commit 5bac8556 (model parameter changes)
- **Files affected:** client.ts, client.test.ts, web-fetch.ts, web-search.ts
- **Key adaptations:**
  - Made model parameter required as per upstream intent
  - Preserved multi-provider architecture in web-fetch.ts
  - Kept our complete rewrite of web-search.ts that uses provider abstraction
  - Updated tests to pass model parameter explicitly

### Commit 93820f83 (folder trust changes)
- **Files affected:** config.ts, settings.ts, trustedFolders.ts, trustedFolders.test.ts, useFolderTrust.ts, configuration.md
- **Key adaptations:**
  - Removed feature flag `folderTrustFeature` - now using settings directly
  - Converted upstream's nested structure `security.folderTrust.enabled` to llxprt's flat `folderTrust` 
  - Updated all trust checks to use the setting directly without feature flag
  - Preserved llxprt documentation and branding in configuration.md
  - Removed config.test.ts as it was deleted in our branch
