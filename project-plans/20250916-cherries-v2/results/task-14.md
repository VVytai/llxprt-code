4. **da22deac** - refactor: remove redundant 'undefined' type or '?' (#2691)

## Conflicts & Resolutions
1. **packages/cli/src/ui/App.tsx** (commit 6f91cfa9):
   - Conflict: Whether to use `userMessages` or `inputHistoryStore.inputHistory`
   - Resolution: Used `inputHistoryStore.inputHistory` to preserve input history after clear
   - Added `inputHistoryStore.addInput()` call while keeping `submitQuery()`

2. **packages/cli/src/ui/hooks/useSlashCompletion** (commit 175fc3bf):
   - Conflict: File exists as .tsx in llxprt, .ts in upstream
   - Resolution: SKIPPED - llxprt has more advanced implementation with file path completion

3. **packages/cli/src/ui/components/FolderTrustDialog.tsx** (commit 421f989f):
   - Conflict: Import paths (process vs node:process)
   - Resolution: Used node:process and node:path, updated branding to llxprt

4. **packages/core/src/core/contentGenerator.ts** (commit da22deac):
   - Conflict: Type definitions with redundant undefined
   - Resolution: Removed redundant undefined while preserving `providerManager` field

5. **packages/cli/src/config/settingsSchema.ts** (commit d0c781a5):
   - Conflict: Large section adding tools settings
   - Resolution: Kept both `dnsResolutionOrder` and new `tools` settings

## Manual Verification Notes
- Commit 175fc3bf was intentionally skipped as llxprt has superior fuzzy matching with file path support
- All branding references changed from "Gemini" to "llxprt"
- Multi-provider architecture preserved throughout
- Smart Edit Tool successfully integrated with settings schema
