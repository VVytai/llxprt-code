## Lines of Code Analysis
- All cherry-picks were successfully applied with minimal conflicts
- Code changes are consistent with upstream commits
- Adaptations were limited to package naming and import paths

## Conflicts & Resolutions

### Commit `93ec574f` (VSCode companion package script fix)
**File: scripts/build_vscode_companion.js**
- **Conflict**: Upstream changed to use npm workspace command with `gemini-cli-vscode-ide-companion`
- **Resolution**: Adapted to use `vscode-ide-companion` without the gemini-cli prefix to match llxprt's package naming convention
- **Justification**: LLxprt uses simplified package names without the gemini-cli prefix

**File: package-lock.json**
- **Conflict**: Version differences and dependency updates
- **Resolution**: Accepted upstream changes (--theirs) as they include the necessary @vscode/vsce dependency

### Commit `2782af3f` (a2a-server refactor)
**File: packages/a2a-server/src/agent/task.test.ts**
- **Conflict**: Import path changes with package name difference
- **Resolution**: Used new directory structure (`../utils/testing_utils.js`) while preserving `@vybestack/llxprt-code-core` package name
- **Justification**: Must maintain llxprt's multi-provider package naming

**File: packages/a2a-server/src/http/app.test.ts**  
- **Conflict**: Import path changes and additional MockTool import with package name difference
- **Resolution**: Used new directory structure while preserving `@vybestack/llxprt-code-core` for both imports
- **Justification**: Must maintain llxprt's multi-provider package naming

## Manual Verification Notes
- All cherry-picks completed successfully
- Conflicts were minimal and related to expected differences (package naming, workspace names)
- No multi-provider support code was affected
- Directory refactoring in a2a-server preserved all llxprt customizations
