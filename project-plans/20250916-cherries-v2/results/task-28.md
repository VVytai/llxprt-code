   - Function signature: Accepted upstream's isWorkspaceTrusted signature
   - Added getIdeTrust import from our package namespace

2. **`packages/cli/src/ui/App.test.tsx`**
   - Mock conflicts: Merged both useFocus and useIdeTrustListener mocks

   - Export conflicts: Merged all exports including our auth system exports
   - Added ide-trust utilities alongside our existing exports

4. **`packages/vscode-ide-companion/src/extension.test.ts`**

   - Added workspace trust handler test

5. **`packages/vscode-ide-companion/src/extension.ts`**

   - Merged openFilesManager as instance variable with broadcastIdeContextUpdate

7. **`packages/vscode-ide-companion/src/ide-server.test.ts`**

### Commits 2-5
- No conflicts, clean cherry-picks with auto-merges where needed

## Manual Verification Notes

### Key Adaptations Made:
1. **Package naming**: All imports maintained as `@vybestack/llxprt-code-core`
2. **Branding**: Kept "LLxprt Code" naming in user-facing strings
3. **File naming**: IDE server files use `llxprt-ide-server-*.json` pattern
4. **Multi-provider support**: Preserved throughout conflict resolution

### Testing Focus Areas:
1. IDE trust integration with VSCode workspace trust
2. IDE server communication with trust state changes
3. Folder trust dialog behavior with IDE override
4. PNG test stability improvements
5. Logging improvements verification
6. E2E tests running on PRs
