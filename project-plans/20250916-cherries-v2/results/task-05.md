## Conflicts & Resolutions

### 1. Settings in Folder trust hook (1fc1c2b4)
- **File:** `packages/cli/src/ui/hooks/useFolderTrust.ts`
  - **Conflict:** Settings parameter passing
  - **Resolution:** Adapted to pass Settings object to isWorkspaceTrusted function
  
- **File:** `packages/cli/src/config/trustedFolders.ts`
  - **Conflict:** Function signature mismatch
  - **Resolution:** Made isWorkspaceTrusted accept optional Settings parameter for compatibility

### 2. Extensions trust validation (2fc85709)
- **File:** `packages/cli/src/config/extension.ts`
  - **Conflict:** Import paths and trust check logic
  - **Resolution:** Preserved llxprt imports, added cwd parameter to installExtension
  
- **File:** `packages/cli/src/config/extension.test.ts`
  - **Conflict:** Test mocks and directory naming
  - **Resolution:** Updated mocks for new function signatures, preserved .llxprt naming

### 3. Screen reader updates (7a56b59f)
- **File:** `packages/cli/src/ui/components/Chat.tsx`
  - **Conflict:** Import statements and TOOL_STATUS usage
  - **Resolution:** Merged imports, integrated TOOL_STATUS for aria-labels
  
- **File:** `packages/cli/src/ui/contexts.tsx`
  - **Conflict:** Import organization
  - **Resolution:** Combined imports preserving both llxprt and upstream additions

### 4. Command trust checks (e9cbdb09)
- **File:** `packages/core/src/utils/ignorePatterns.test.ts`
  - **Conflict:** Test mocks for trust functions
  - **Resolution:** Added isInTrustedDirectory mock to trustedFolders module

## Manual Verification Notes

### Preserved llxprt Features:
- Multi-provider architecture maintained
- Package naming (@vybestack/llxprt-code-core) preserved
- Branding (.llxprt directory) maintained
- Flat settings structure (vs nested) preserved
- Import style conventions maintained

### Key Adaptations:
- Settings structure: Used flat `folderTrust` and `folderTrustFeature` instead of nested `security.folderTrust`
- Extension management: Changed from `settings.experimental?.extensionManagement` to `settings.extensionManagement`
- Trust checks: Made isWorkspaceTrusted flexible to work with or without Settings parameter

### Test Impact:
- Updated multiple test files to include new trust-related mocks
- All test utilities now include proper folder trust stubs
- Extension tests updated for new cwd parameter requirements
