## Lines of Code Analysis
- Upstream: 5 files changed, 509 insertions(+), 43 deletions(-)
- Local: 5 files changed, 509 insertions(+), 44 deletions(-)
- Analysis: Nearly identical stats (within tolerance). The +1 deletion difference is from removing the unused `mergeWith` import that was included in upstream but not used.

## Conflicts & Resolutions
- **File:** `packages/cli/src/config/settings.ts`
  - **Conflict:** Import statements conflict
  - **Resolution:** Merged both sets of imports, preserving llxprt's existing imports:
    - Kept `isFolderTrustEnabled` from `trustedFolders.js` (llxprt-specific)
    - Kept non-type imports from `settingsSchema.js` including `SETTINGS_SCHEMA` (llxprt-specific)
    - Added `resolveEnvVarsInObject` from `../utils/envVarResolver.js` (upstream)
    - Initially added `mergeWith` from `lodash-es` but removed it as it was unused and caused lint failure
  - **Justification:** llxprt uses enhanced folder trust features and non-type imports that must be preserved
  - **Additional Fix:** Removed unused `mergeWith` import to fix lint error (commit 8abd17082)

## Manual Verification Notes
- Environment variable resolution functionality extracted to dedicated module for better code organization
- No multi-provider functionality affected
- No branding changes required
- All llxprt-specific imports preserved
- Quality gates all passed after fixing unused import issue
- Logs saved in `.quality-logs/task-12/`
