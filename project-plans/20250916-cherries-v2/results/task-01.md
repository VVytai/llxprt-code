- Also includes the llxprt adaptations for token storage (type renames)

## Conflicts & Resolutions

### Conflict 1: token-storage base files (58f68288)
- **Conflict Type**: modify/delete - files existed in upstream but were being added as new
- **Resolution**: Accepted the new files and adapted them:
  - Changed imports from `./types.js` to `../token-store.js`
  - Replaced `OAuthCredentials` with `MCPOAuthCredentials` throughout
  - Replaced `OAuthToken` with `MCPOAuthToken` throughout
  - Changed `.gemini` directory to `.llxprt`
  - Updated encryption keys from `gemini-cli` to `llxprt-code`

### Conflict 2: process-utils.ts (92bb34fa)
- **Conflict Type**: Content merge conflict in PowerShell implementation
- **Resolution**: Preserved llxprt's error handling with try-catch while applying upstream's PowerShell fix
  - Kept our structured PowerShell command building
  - Applied upstream's fix to use `command=` instead of `comm=` for Unix

### Conflict 3: config.test.ts (92bb34fa)
- **Conflict Type**: Content conflict with settings mock
- **Resolution**: Kept llxprt's settings mock that was added in our version

### Conflict 4: settings.ts (fb7a34dc)
- **Conflict Type**: Content conflict - upstream removing logs from non-existent migration code
- **Resolution**: Rejected all changes as the migration code doesn't exist in llxprt

## Lines of Code Analysis
- Upstream: 4 commits attempted, 2 skipped, 2 applied
- Added ~764 lines for token storage classes
- Modified ~48 lines for PowerShell process utils
- Skipped VS Code extension changes (not applicable)
- Skipped settings migration log removal (not applicable)

## Manual Verification Notes
- Token storage classes properly integrated with llxprt's MCP OAuth types
- PowerShell command execution preserved with proper error handling
- Multi-provider architecture remains intact
- All llxprt branding and customizations preserved
- No provider-specific code leaked into the multi-provider architecture
- NOTE: The token storage adaptations (type renames) were accidentally included in commit 9547bf0e6 along with the PowerShell fixes due to staging during conflict resolution. This doesn't affect functionality but explains why that commit touches more files than expected.
