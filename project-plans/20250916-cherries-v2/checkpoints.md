- [x] Key outcomes:
  - Adopted upstream V2 nested settings schema with comment-preserving writers and legacy alias getters
  - IDE workspace trust now overrides folder trust consistently across CLI, IDE companion, and core services
  - OAuth error handling hardened; stream retry logic and loop detection prevent duplicate output
  - Shell execution throughput improved while retaining llxprt git stats telemetry

- [x] Notes / follow-ups:
  - Task 31 captured as future work: design provider-aware auth enforcement
  - IdeClient refactor and extension notification/bundle changes intentionally deferred
  - ✅ Merge marker created: `git merge -s ours 4aef2fa5d` (commit 9fe4b1b49)

## Final Merge Marker (Completed)

**Date:** 2025-09-19 11:29:55 -0300
**Commit:** 9fe4b1b490bcd47f6e4a8c32d9eae39cd234df0b
**Command:** `git merge -s ours --no-ff 4aef2fa5d -S`

This merge marker officially records that llxprt-code has been synchronized with upstream gemini-cli up to commit 4aef2fa5d (temp disable windows e2e tests #7746).

The merge uses the `-s ours` strategy to create an empty merge commit that:
1. Marks the sync point for future cherry-pick cycles
2. Prevents accidental re-cherry-picking of already integrated commits
3. Documents that all upstream changes were selectively integrated

All 34 tasks from the 20250916 cherry-pick plan have been successfully completed with:
- All tests passing
- All linting checks passing
- All typechecks passing
- All builds succeeding
- Multi-provider architecture preserved
- llxprt branding maintained
