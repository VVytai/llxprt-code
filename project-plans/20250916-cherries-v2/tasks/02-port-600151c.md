# Task 02 â€“ PORT 600151cc

**Task Type:** PORT\n**Area:** core\n**Risk Level:** low\n**Results File:** `project-plans/20250916-cherries-v2/results/task-02.md`\n
## Commit Details
- Upstream hash: `600151cc`
- Description: Strip thoughts when loading history
- Rationale: Missing stripThoughts option (add stripThoughts:true in slashCommandProcessor)

## Execution Steps
1. Cherry-pick the commit with metadata preserved:
   ```bash
   git cherry-pick -x 600151cc
   ```
2. Resolve conflicts carefully, preserving llxprt branding, settings shape, and multi-provider paths. Document every adaptation in the results file.
3. Capture upstream and local diffs in `project-plans/20250916-cherries-v2/results/task-02.md` using the template.
4. Run the automated quality gate (fails stop progress):
   ```bash
   ./project-plans/20250916-cherries-v2/run-quality-gates.sh project-plans/20250916-cherries-v2/results/task-02.md
   ```
5. Address any failures, update the results file, and rerun until the script passes.
6. Stage the results/log updates only after the gate passes.
7. Ask Claude to run the Codex audit (10-minute shell timeout):
   ```bash
   CLAUDE_PROMPT=$(cat <<'PROMPT'
   codex exec "Evaluate the cherry-pick task results in project-plans/20250916-cherries-v2/results/task-02.md. Check:
     1. Were ALL commits listed in the task file actually cherry-picked? Use \"git log --oneline -n 1\" to verify. List any missing commits.
     2. Review the actual code changes with \"git diff HEAD~1\" - do they match what the task intended? Check for:
        - Unauthorized settings migrations or schema changes
        - Package name changes beyond @vybestack/llxprt-code-core replacements
        - Removal of multi-provider support code
        - Addition of Gemini-specific code that breaks provider abstraction
     3. Did the quality gate script pass? Check the log file at project-plans/20250916-cherries-v2/.quality-logs/task-02 for any failures.
     4. Run "npm test" and verify ZERO test failures. List all failing tests if any.
     5. Run "npm run lint" and "npm run typecheck" - must have ZERO errors.
     6. Check "git status" - working tree MUST be clean with no uncommitted changes.
     7. Does the results file document all conflicts and resolutions?

     VERDICT: Provide one of these EXACT responses:
     - 'DO NOT CONTINUE. YOU MUST FIX: [specific issues]' if ANY check fails
     - 'THIS PASSED. YOU MAY PROCEED TO NEXT TASK' if ALL checks pass

     Be extremely critical. Any test failure, lint error, or unauthorized change means DO NOT CONTINUE."

   claude --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox \
     -C "$REPO_ROOT" \
     exec --timeout 600000 "$CLAUDE_PROMPT"
   ```
   Proceed only if Claude replies `THIS PASSED. YOU MAY PROCEED TO NEXT TASK`.



## Reminders
- Double-check for lingering "Gemini" strings or single-provider assumptions.
- Note any manual test coverage specific to this feature (e.g., OAuth flows, MCP start-up).
