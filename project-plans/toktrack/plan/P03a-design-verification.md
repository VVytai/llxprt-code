# Design Verification

## Phase ID
`PLAN-20250909-TOKTRACK.P03a`

## Purpose
Verify that the design phase has produced all necessary artifacts and that the design is complete and implementable.

## Verification Checklist

### Design Completeness
- [ ] All requirements from P02 are addressed in the design
- [ ] Pseudocode exists for all major components
- [ ] Integration points are clearly identified
- [ ] User access points are defined
- [ ] Data flow is documented

### Pseudocode Verification
- [ ] All pseudocode files have line numbers
- [ ] Pseudocode covers all REQ tags
- [ ] Algorithm steps are clear and implementable
- [ ] Error handling is included in pseudocode

### Integration Planning
- [ ] Specific files to modify are listed
- [ ] No isolated feature building is possible
- [ ] Migration path is defined
- [ ] Deprecation strategy exists

## Success Criteria
- All checklist items verified
- Design can be handed to implementation team
- No ambiguity in implementation approach

## Next Phase
Proceed to P04 (Core Implementation) only after verification passes
