# Quality Assurance

## Code Quality

1. All new code follows existing style conventions
2. Proper typing is used throughout implementation
3. Error handling is robust and comprehensive

## Testing

1. Unit tests cover all new functionality:
   - Tokens per minute calculation accuracy
   - Throttle wait time accumulation
   - Session token usage tracking

2. Integration tests verify proper coordination between components:
   - ProviderPerformanceTracker and ProviderManager interaction
   - Retry system integration with token tracking
   - UI components correctly display updated metrics

3. Edge case testing:
   - Empty token windows for TPM calculation
   - Multiple consecutive 429 errors
   - Provider switching with accumulated metrics

## Performance

1. No noticeable performance degradation in normal usage
2. Token tracking overhead is minimal
3. UI updates are efficient and non-blocking

## Security

1. New metrics don't expose sensitive information
2. All existing security measures remain intact

## Compatibility

1. All existing provider implementations continue to work
2. No breaking changes to public APIs
3. Backward compatibility maintained for external integrations
