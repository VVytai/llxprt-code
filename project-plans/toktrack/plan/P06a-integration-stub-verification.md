# Integration Stub Verification

## Verification Steps

1. Confirm plan identifies specific existing files that will use the feature:
   - ProviderPerformanceTracker.ts
   - ProviderManager.ts
   - LoggingProviderWrapper.ts
   - retry.ts
   - loggers.ts
   - Footer.tsx
   - StatsDisplay.tsx
   - diagnosticsCommand.ts

2. Confirm plan shows how existing files will be modified, not duplicated:
   - All files in the changes summary will be UPDATED, not replaced with new versions

3. Confirm plan shows how users will access the feature:
   - Through UI components (Footer, StatsDisplay)
   - Through diagnostics command output

4. Confirm the feature cannot be built in isolation:
   - Token tracking requires integration with API response handling
   - Requires integration with telemetry system
   - Requires integration with UI components
   - Requires integration with retry logic for 429 handling

5. Confirm mutation testing requirements:
   - Plan will implement mutation testing with Stryker
   - Minimum 80% mutation score required for implementation phases

## Results

[OK] All requirements met:
- Specific files identified that will use the feature
- No isolated implementation possible
- Clear user access points defined
- Integration requirements documented
- Mutation testing requirements documented

## Compliance Check

- [x] Lists specific existing files that will use the feature
- [x] Identifies exact code to be replaced/removed
- [x] Shows how users will access the feature
- [x] Includes migration plan for existing data
- [x] Has integration test phases (not just unit tests)
- [x] Feature CANNOT work without modifying existing files
- [x] Feature is NOT built in isolation
- [x] Mutation testing with 80% score minimum requirement included
