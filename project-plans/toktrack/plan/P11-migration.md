# Migration Phase

This phase details how existing token tracking data and configurations will be migrated to work with the new token tracking enhancement.

## Migration Requirements

1. Existing ProviderPerformanceMetrics instances should be compatible with new interface
2. Existing telemetry logs should continue to work with new metrics
3. Existing UI configuration should display new metrics
4. Existing provider wrapper implementations should accumulate token usage

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Backward Compatibility for ProviderPerformanceMetrics
- Ensure new fields have appropriate default values (0 for counts, null for wait times)
- Verify existing code can handle the enhanced interface without breaking

### Step 2: Migration of Telemetry Data
- Update telemetry logging to include new fields without disrupting existing logging
- Ensure logs can be parsed with both old and new schema

### Step 3: UI Configuration Migration
- Modify footer and stats display components to show new metrics by default
- Ensure CLI configuration doesn't need special migration for token tracking

### Step 4: Provider Wrapper Migration
- Update all provider wrapper implementations to accumulate session tokens
- Verify integration with both new and existing providers

## Data Conversion

No specific data conversion is needed as:
1. New fields in ProviderPerformanceMetrics are additive
2. Existing tracking continues to work unchanged
3. New tracking information is accumulated on top of existing data

## Validation Steps

1. Run existing telemetry tests with new metrics
2. Verify UI components work with both old and new tracking data
3. Test provider wrappers with various provider types
4. Confirm no disruptions to existing functionality
