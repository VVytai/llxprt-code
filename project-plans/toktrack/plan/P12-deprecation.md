# Deprecation Phase

This phase details how any old token tracking implementations will be deprecated and removed in favor of the new enhanced system.

## Deprecation Requirements

There are no existing token tracking implementations that need to be deprecated, as the current system only has basic token counting and no throttling or session tracking.

The new enhancement builds on top of the existing metrics infrastructure without replacing any existing functions.

## Implementation Steps

1. No methods need to be deprecated as the enhancement is additive
2. Document the new capabilities in code comments
3. Update usage documentation to reflect new tracking capabilities

## Validation Steps

1. Confirm no existing functionality is broken
2. Verify all existing metrics still work as before
3. Ensure new metrics are properly documented
