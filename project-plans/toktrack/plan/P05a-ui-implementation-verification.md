# UI Implementation Verification

## Phase ID
`PLAN-20250909-TOKTRACK.P05a`

## Purpose
Verify that UI components correctly display token tracking metrics and integrate with the core implementation.

## Verification Requirements

### Component Checks
- [ ] Footer component displays TPM and throttle wait time
- [ ] StatsDisplay shows detailed token breakdown
- [ ] Diagnostics command includes new metrics
- [ ] UI updates in real-time during conversations

### Integration Testing
```bash
# Run UI component tests
npm test packages/cli/src/ui/components/

# Test diagnostics command
npm test packages/cli/src/ui/commands/diagnosticsCommand.test.ts
```

### Visual Verification
- [ ] TPM formatting handles various ranges (0 to 100k+)
- [ ] Throttle wait time uses appropriate units (ms, seconds, minutes)
- [ ] Session token breakdown sums correctly
- [ ] UI doesn't overflow with large values

### User Access Verification
- [ ] Footer shows metrics during active sessions
- [ ] Stats display accessible via UI
- [ ] Diagnostics command outputs all metrics
- [ ] Metrics are human-readable

### Phase Markers
```bash
grep -r "@plan:PLAN-20250909-TOKTRACK.P05" packages/cli/ | wc -l
# Expected: 8+ occurrences
```

## Success Criteria
- All UI components display metrics correctly
- Integration with core implementation verified
- User can access all token tracking features
- No UI rendering issues

## Next Phase
Proceed to P06 (Integration Stub) only after verification passes
