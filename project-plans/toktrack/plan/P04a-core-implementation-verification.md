# Core Implementation Verification

## Phase ID
`PLAN-20250909-TOKTRACK.P04a`

## Purpose
Verify that the core implementation phase has correctly implemented all core components according to the design and pseudocode.

## Verification Requirements

### Code Quality Checks
```bash
# TypeScript compilation
npm run typecheck

# Linting
npm run lint

# Test execution
npm test packages/core/src/providers/

# Mutation testing
npx stryker run --mutate packages/core/src/providers/
# Expected: â‰¥80% mutation score
```

### Implementation Verification
- [ ] ProviderPerformanceMetrics interface has all new fields
- [ ] ProviderPerformanceTracker implements TPM calculation (pseudocode lines 44-50)
- [ ] ProviderPerformanceTracker implements throttle tracking (pseudocode lines 75-77)
- [ ] ProviderManager implements session token accumulation (pseudocode lines 21-28)
- [ ] All methods follow pseudocode line-by-line

### Test Coverage
- [ ] All new methods have behavioral tests
- [ ] Property-based tests exist for TPM calculation
- [ ] Property-based tests exist for token accumulation
- [ ] No reverse testing patterns found
- [ ] No mock theater in tests

### Phase Markers
```bash
grep -r "@plan:PLAN-20250909-TOKTRACK.P04" packages/core/ | wc -l
# Expected: 10+ occurrences
```

## Success Criteria
- All verification checks pass
- 80% mutation score achieved
- All pseudocode references verified
- Tests demonstrate real behavior

## Next Phase
Proceed to P05 (UI Implementation) only after verification passes
