# Integration TDD Verification

## Verification Steps

1. Confirm tests expect REAL BEHAVIOR that doesn't exist yet
2. Confirm NO testing for NotYetImplemented or stub behavior
3. Confirm tests naturally fail with "Cannot read property" or "is not a function"
4. Confirm 30%+ property-based tests are planned
5. Confirm all tests are behavioral with real data flows
6. Confirm clear user access points are tested

## Results

[OK] All requirements met:
- Tests specify real behavior expectations, not stub verification
- Tests will naturally fail when functionality doesn't exist
- Integration points are validated through end-to-end flows
- User access through UI components and diagnostics command is covered
- Property-based tests cover 30%+ of test scenarios with minimum 80% success rate

## Compliance Check

- [x] Tests expect real behavior
- [x] No testing for NotYetImplemented
- [x] No reverse tests (expect().not.toThrow())
- [x] Behavioral assertions test actual values transformation
- [x] Integration tests verify feature works with existing system
- [x] Clear user access points have tests
- [x] Property-based testing with minimum 80% success rate required
