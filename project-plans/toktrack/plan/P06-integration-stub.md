# Integration Stub Phase

This phase details how the token tracking enhancement will be integrated with the existing LLxprt Code system.

## Integration Points

1. ProviderPerformanceTracker will be modified to track tokens per minute and throttle wait times
2. ProviderManager will accumulate session token usage across all providers
3. LoggingProviderWrapper will extract token counts from API responses and accumulate them
4. Retry system will track cumulative 429 wait times
5. Telemetry system will record new metrics with each API response
6. UI components (Footer, StatsDisplay) will display the new metrics
7. Diagnostics command will include new metrics in output

## Implementation Requirements

- All modifications must integrate with existing systems
- No isolated features - each component must work with the others
- Metrics must flow consistently from API responses through the tracking system to UI displays
