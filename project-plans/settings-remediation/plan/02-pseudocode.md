# Phase 2: Pseudocode Development

## Worker Prompt

```bash
Based on specification.md and analysis/domain-model.md, create detailed pseudocode for the remediated SettingsService.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Number each line of pseudocode
2. NO file system operations anywhere
3. Simple in-memory object storage
4. Synchronous operations only
5. Event emission on changes
6. Clear separation from persistence concerns

The pseudocode must show:
- How SettingsService stores settings in memory only
- How Config delegates to SettingsService
- Event flow for changes
- What code gets removed

Output to analysis/pseudocode/settings-service-remediation.md
```

## Expected Output

Numbered pseudocode showing:
- SettingsService class with in-memory storage
- Config class delegation pattern
- Event emission logic
- Migration/cleanup steps
- NO async operations
- NO file operations

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Every line numbered
- [ ] No file system operations present
- [ ] All operations synchronous
- [ ] Event emission included
- [ ] Shows what to remove from current implementation
