# Phase 5a: Settings Service Implementation Verification

## Verification Steps

```bash
# 1. All tests pass
npm test packages/core/test/settings/SettingsService.spec.ts || exit 1

# 2. Verify pseudocode was followed
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p "
Compare packages/core/src/settings/SettingsService.ts with 
analysis/pseudocode/settings-service-remediation.md lines 01-78.

Check:
1. Constructor has no repository (lines 05-14)
2. get() is synchronous (lines 16-23)
3. set() emits events (lines 25-38)
4. No file operations anywhere
5. EventEmitter used for events

Report any deviations.
"

# 3. Check no file operations remain
grep -r "fs\.\|readFile\|writeFile\|path.join" packages/core/src/settings/SettingsService.ts
[ $? -eq 0 ] && echo "FAIL: File operations found"

# 4. Check all operations synchronous
grep -r "async\|await\|Promise\|then\|catch" packages/core/src/settings/SettingsService.ts
[ $? -eq 0 ] && echo "FAIL: Async operations found"

# 5. Performance test - operations should be instant
node -e "
const { SettingsService } = require('./packages/core/dist/src/settings/SettingsService.js');
const service = new SettingsService();
const start = Date.now();
for (let i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
  service.set('key' + i, i);
  service.get('key' + i);
}
const elapsed = Date.now() - start;
console.assert(elapsed < 100, 'Operations too slow: ' + elapsed + 'ms');
console.log('10000 operations in ' + elapsed + 'ms');
"

# 6. Verify events work
node -e "
const { SettingsService } = require('./packages/core/dist/src/settings/SettingsService.js');
const service = new SettingsService();
let eventFired = false;
service.on('change', (e) => { eventFired = true; });
service.set('test', 'value');
console.assert(eventFired, 'Event did not fire');
"
```

## Expected Results

- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ Pseudocode followed exactly
- ✅ No file operations
- ✅ All synchronous
- ✅ Performance <100ms for 10k ops
- ✅ Events working
