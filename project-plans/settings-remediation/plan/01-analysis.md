# Phase 1: Analysis

## Worker Prompt

```bash
Analyze the settings remediation requirements from specification.md.

Create a detailed domain analysis that covers:
1. The fundamental difference between ephemeral and persistent settings
2. Why SettingsService should NOT have file operations
3. The synchronous vs async access patterns needed
4. Event-driven update flow
5. Integration touchpoints with existing code

Focus on understanding WHY the current implementation is backwards and what the correct architecture should be.

Output to analysis/domain-model.md
```

## Expected Output

- Clear distinction between ephemeral (runtime) and persistent (saved) settings
- Identified anti-patterns in current implementation
- State transition diagrams for setting updates
- Event flow documentation
- Edge cases and error scenarios

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Explains why file operations are wrong for ephemeral settings
- [ ] Documents synchronous access requirements
- [ ] Maps all integration points
- [ ] Identifies code to be removed
- [ ] No implementation details, only domain understanding
