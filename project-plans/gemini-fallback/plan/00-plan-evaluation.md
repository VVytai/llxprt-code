# Plan: Gemini OAuth Fallback

# Plan Evaluation

## Phase ID

`PLAN-20250822-GEMINIFALLBACK.EVAL`

## Evaluation Task

Evaluate the plan in project-plans/gemini-fallback/ against PLAN.md requirements:

## Evaluation Criteria

CRITICAL - Check integration FIRST (if this fails, reject entire plan):
1. Does plan list SPECIFIC existing files that will use the feature?
2. Does plan identify EXACT old code to be replaced/removed?
3. Does plan show how users will ACCESS the feature?
4. Does plan include integration phases (not just unit tests)?
5. Can feature be built in COMPLETE ISOLATION? (If yes, REJECT)

Then check implementation quality:
6. Pseudocode has line numbers and is referenced in implementation
7. No NotYetImplemented patterns in stubs
8. No reverse testing in TDD phases
9. Implementation phases reference pseudocode line numbers
10. Verification includes mutation testing (80% minimum)
11. Property-based testing requirement (30% minimum)
12. All files are UPDATED not created as new versions
13. Behavioral contract verification in place

## Evaluation Process

This evaluation checks if the plan meets all requirements from PLAN.md.

### Integration Analysis

The plan properly identifies integration points:

1. **Specific existing files that will use the feature:**
   - `packages/core/src/providers/gemini/GeminiProvider.ts` - Will call clipboard utilities and set global state variables
   - `packages/cli/src/ui/App.tsx` - Will detect OAuth state and show dialog
   - `packages/cli/src/ui/components/OAuthCodeDialog.tsx` - Will display provider-specific instructions
   - `packages/core/src/code_assist/oauth2.ts` - Will integrate clipboard functionality with OAuth flow

2. **Exact old code to be replaced/removed:**
   - `packages/core/src/code_assist/oauth2.ts` - Legacy OAuth URL display implementation to be wrapped with clipboard functionality

3. **How users will ACCESS the feature:**
   - CLI: Any command requiring Gemini provider authentication automatically triggers the flow
   - UI: OAuthCodeDialog component when triggered by Gemini provider

4. **Integration phases included:**
   - Yes, phases 13-15 specifically address integration requirements

5. **Feature cannot be built in isolation:**
   - No, it requires modifications to existing core files and UI components

### Implementation Quality

6. **Pseudocode has line numbers and is referenced:**
   - Yes, the pseudocode file has numbered lines and implementation phases reference line numbers

7. **No NotYetImplemented patterns in stubs:**
   - The stub phases require creating minimal implementations that compile but don't yet work

8. **No reverse testing in TDD phases:**
   - TDD phases require behavioral tests that naturally fail without implementation

9. **Implementation phases reference pseudocode line numbers:**
   - Yes, implementation phases explicitly reference pseudocode line numbers

10. **Verification includes mutation testing:**
    - Not explicitly mentioned, but this should be added to verification processes

11. **Property-based testing requirement (30% minimum):**
    - Yes, each TDD and verification phase includes property-based tests requirement

12. **All files are UPDATED not created as new versions:**
    - Yes, the plan specifies modifying existing files rather than creating new ones

13. **Behavioral contract verification in place:**
    - Yes, tests must focus on behavior rather than implementation details

## Plan Quality Assessment

The plan:
- Properly addresses integration requirements
- Identifies specific files to modify
- Shows clear user access points
- References pseudocode in implementation phases
- Includes property-based testing requirements
- Follows the pattern of modifying existing files rather than creating isolated features

Areas for improvement:
- Explicitly add mutation testing verification to implementation phases
- Include more details about test data preparation
- Add more specific cross-platform testing scenarios

Overall assessment: The plan meets the core requirements for TDD implementation with proper integration focus.
