# Phase 06a: Clipboard Functionality Implementation Verification

## Phase ID

`PLAN-20250822-GEMINIFALLBACK.P06A`

## Prerequisites

- Required: Phase 06 completed
- Verification: `grep -r "@plan:PLAN-20250822-GEMINIFALLBACK.P06" .`

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check plan markers exist
PLAN_MARKERS=$(grep -r "@plan:PLAN-20250822-GEMINIFALLBACK.P06" . | wc -l)
if [ "$PLAN_MARKERS" -lt 3 ]; then
  echo "FAIL: Expected 3+ plan markers, found $PLAN_MARKERS"
  exit 1
fi

# Check requirements covered
REQ_MARKERS=$(grep -r "@requirement:REQ-001" packages/core/src/services/ClipboardService.ts | wc -l)
if [ "$REQ_MARKERS" -lt 3 ]; then
  echo "FAIL: Expected 3+ requirement markers, found $REQ_MARKERS"
  exit 1
fi

# All tests pass
npm test -- packages/core/src/services/ClipboardService.test.ts
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "FAIL: ClipboardService tests failed"
  exit 1
fi

# No test modifications
git diff test/ | grep -E "^[+-]" | grep -v "^[+-]{3}" && echo "FAIL: Tests modified" && exit 1

# Verify pseudocode was followed
# This will be verified by checking that implementation matches pseudocode:
# - Platform detection implemented
# - Clipboard utility selection matches pseudocode
# - Execution flow follows pseudocode lines 29-36

# No debug code
grep -r "console\.\|TODO\|FIXME\|XXX" packages/core/src/services/ClipboardService.ts && echo "FAIL: Debug code found" && exit 1

# No duplicate files
find packages/core/src/services -name "*V2*" -o -name "*Copy*" && echo "FAIL: Duplicate versions found" && exit 1

# Run mutation testing
npx stryker run --mutate packages/core/src/services/ClipboardService.ts
MUTATION_SCORE=$(jq -r '.metrics.mutationScore' .stryker-tmp/reports/mutation-report.json)
if (( $(echo "$MUTATION_SCORE < 80" | bc -l) )); then
  echo "FAIL: Mutation score only $MUTATION_SCORE% (minimum 80%)"
  exit 1
fi

echo "clipboard-implementation-verification completed successfully"
```

## Success Criteria

- All verification commands pass
- Implementation follows pseudocode exactly
- No test modifications during implementation
- No debug code or TODO comments
- No duplicate versions created
- Mutation testing score >= 80%
