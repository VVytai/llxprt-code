## Preserved llxprt Features

Throughout the operation, we maintained:

1. **Multi-Provider Architecture**
   - USE_PROVIDER instead of provider-specific auth
   - Support for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and other providers
   - Provider-agnostic interfaces

2. **Branding and Naming**
   - @vybestack/llxprt-code-core package naming
   - .llxprt directory structure
   - LLXPRT_* environment variables

3. **Extended Authentication**
   - OAuth support for multiple providers
   - API key management for all providers
   - Provider switching capabilities

4. **Privacy Features**
   - No telemetry collection
   - Local-only logging
   - No ClearcutLogger integration

## Technical Details

### Conflict Resolution Strategy
- Package imports: @google/gemini-cli-core → @vybestack/llxprt-code-core
- Auth types: USE_GEMINI → USE_PROVIDER
- Directory paths: .gemini → .llxprt
- Environment variables: GEMINI_* → LLXPRT_* (with backward compatibility)

### Build Status
- ✅ TypeScript compilation: Success
- ✅ Linting: Minor warnings only
- ✅ Core package: Builds successfully
- ✅ CLI package: Builds successfully
- ✅ VSCode companion: Builds successfully

### Test Status
- Main test suite: ~2700 passing, ~100 failing (mostly test expectation mismatches)
- Integration tests: Passing
- Unit tests: Mostly passing with some mock configuration issues

## Remaining Work

1. **Test Fixes**
   - Update test expectations for API changes
   - Fix mock configurations
   - Resolve merge conflict markers in test files

2. **Documentation**
   - Update README with new features
   - Document extension management system
   - Update configuration guides

3. **Final Merge Commit**
   ```bash
   git merge -s ours --no-ff <last-upstream-commit> -m "Merge upstream gemini-cli v0.3.4
   
   Cherry-picked 98 commits from upstream while preserving llxprt's
   multi-provider architecture and unique features.
   
   Maintains llxprt's multi-provider support, branding, and authentication
   differences while incorporating upstream improvements."
   ```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Pre-filtering is crucial**: Many commits should have been identified as SKIP category upfront
2. **Extension system complexity**: The extension management system had deep integration that made partial adoption challenging
3. **Storage refactoring impact**: The centralized storage change touched many files but was worth the effort
4. **Test maintenance**: Cherry-picking can break many tests due to API and expectation changes

## Recommendation

The cherry-pick operation was successful. The codebase is now:
- Up-to-date with valuable upstream improvements
- Maintaining all llxprt-specific features
- Building successfully
- Ready for continued development

Next steps should focus on:
1. Fixing remaining test failures
2. Creating the final merge commit
3. Testing multi-provider functionality thoroughly
4. Documenting the new features for users
