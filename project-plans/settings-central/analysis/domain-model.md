# Domain Analysis: Settings Centralization

## 1. Entity Relationships

### 1.1 Settings Service → Repository (1:1)
- **ISettingsService** maintains a single persistent connection to **ISettingsRepository**
- Repository acts as the sole persistence layer for settings data
- Service delegates all file operations to repository while maintaining in-memory cache
- Relationship is immutable once service is initialized

### 1.2 Settings Service → Providers (1:N)
- **ISettingsService** manages multiple provider configurations simultaneously
- Each provider (openai, qwen, gemini, anthropic, glm) has distinct settings schema
- Service maintains active provider reference and can switch between providers atomically
- Provider instances receive settings updates through event notification system

### 1.3 Settings Service → Event Emitter (1:1)
- Service extends or contains **EventEmitter** for change notifications
- Events fire after successful persistence operations
- Multiple consumers can subscribe to settings change events
- Event emission failure is non-blocking but logged for debugging

### 1.4 Provider → Settings Snapshot (1:1)
- Each provider instance holds current settings snapshot from service
- Snapshots are immutable and replaced on settings changes
- Provider must not modify snapshot data directly
- Stale snapshots are prevented through event-driven updates

## 2. State Transitions

### 2.1 Initial Load: File → Memory → Providers
```
[Settings File] → [Repository.load()] → [Service.initialize()] → [In-Memory Cache] → [Provider.updateSettings()]
```
- Repository reads persisted settings from file system
- Service validates loaded data against schemas
- Valid settings populate in-memory cache
- All registered providers receive initial settings snapshot
- Invalid/corrupt files trigger default settings fallback

### 2.2 Update: Validate → Memory → File → Events → Providers
```
[User Input] → [Schema Validation] → [Memory Update] → [File Persistence] → [Event Emission] → [Provider Updates]
```
- Input validation prevents invalid state transitions
- Memory update occurs only after validation passes
- File persistence follows successful memory update
- Events fire only after successful persistence
- Provider updates are asynchronous and non-blocking

### 2.3 Switch Provider: Validate → Update Active → Events → Reinitialize
```
[Switch Request] → [Target Provider Validation] → [Active Provider Update] → [Settings Event] → [Provider Reinitialization]
```
- Target provider configuration must exist and be valid
- Active provider reference updates atomically
- Provider switch event includes old and new provider identifiers
- Affected providers reinitialize with new active settings
- Failed switches leave current provider unchanged

### 2.4 Reset: Load Defaults → Memory → File → Events
```
[Reset Command] → [Default Settings Load] → [Memory Replace] → [File Overwrite] → [Reset Event] → [Provider Updates]
```
- Default settings loaded from predefined schemas
- Complete memory replacement, not partial updates
- File system persistence overwrites existing data
- Reset event notifies all consumers of state restoration
- Providers receive fresh default configurations

## 3. Business Rules

### 3.1 Settings Validation Rules
- All settings must validate against provider-specific Zod schemas before persistence
- Temperature values constrained between 0.0 and 2.0 inclusive
- Base URLs must be valid HTTP/HTTPS URLs when provided
- API keys are optional but must be non-empty strings when present
- Model names must match provider-supported model identifiers

### 3.2 Provider Switch Rules
- Provider switch operations must update baseUrl and model atomically
- Cannot switch to provider with incomplete required configuration
- Active provider must always reference valid provider configuration
- Switch operations rollback completely on any validation failure
- Provider instances must reinitialize after active provider changes

### 3.3 State Consistency Rules
- Failed updates must not modify any in-memory or persisted state
- Memory and file system must remain synchronized at all times
- Partial updates are prohibited - all changes are atomic
- Concurrent operations use last-write-wins conflict resolution
- Backup state maintained during destructive operations

### 3.4 Event System Rules
- Events must fire after successful persistence, never before
- Event emission failure does not rollback successful operations
- All registered listeners receive events in registration order
- Events contain complete change context for consumer decision-making
- Providers must not cache settings locally, only react to events

### 3.5 Provider Integration Rules
- Providers must not cache settings locally beyond current snapshot
- Settings snapshots are immutable and replaced entirely on changes
- Provider initialization failures do not affect settings service state
- Multiple providers can be configured but only one active at a time
- Provider-specific settings isolated to prevent cross-contamination

## 4. Edge Cases

### 4.1 Corrupt Settings File → Load Defaults
- **Scenario**: JSON parse errors, invalid schema, or missing required fields
- **Response**: Log corruption details, backup corrupt file, load default settings
- **Recovery**: Service continues with defaults, user notified of corruption
- **Prevention**: Settings validation on every write operation

### 4.2 Missing Provider Config → Use Defaults
- **Scenario**: Requested provider not in settings file
- **Response**: Create default configuration for missing provider
- **Integration**: New provider config validated and persisted immediately
- **User Experience**: Seamless provider addition without manual configuration

### 4.3 Invalid API Key → Allow Save but Mark Invalid
- **Scenario**: API key format validation passes but authentication fails
- **Response**: Save configuration with invalid status flag
- **Provider Behavior**: Provider reports authentication errors during usage
- **User Feedback**: UI indicates authentication status per provider

### 4.4 Concurrent Updates → Last Write Wins
- **Scenario**: Multiple settings update requests arrive simultaneously
- **Resolution**: Serialize operations through service queue
- **Data Integrity**: Complete operations succeed, incomplete operations fail
- **User Notification**: Failed operations return appropriate error messages

### 4.5 File System Errors → Retry with Exponential Backoff
- **Scenario**: Disk full, permissions error, or file system unavailable
- **Response**: Exponential backoff retry (100ms, 200ms, 400ms, 800ms, 1600ms)
- **Fallback**: After 5 failures, operate in memory-only mode
- **Recovery**: Automatic persistence resume when file system recovers

## 5. Error Scenarios

### 5.1 Validation Failure → Return Error, No State Change
- **Trigger**: Schema validation fails on settings update
- **Behavior**: Validation error returned to caller immediately
- **State**: No changes to memory cache or persisted settings
- **Recovery**: User corrects input and retries operation
- **Logging**: Validation errors logged with input context

### 5.2 File Write Failure → Rollback Memory, Emit Error Event
- **Trigger**: File system write operation fails after memory update
- **Behavior**: Memory state rolled back to previous valid state
- **Events**: Error event emitted with failure context
- **Providers**: Notified of rollback through error event
- **Retry**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff strategy

### 5.3 Provider Initialization Failure → Keep Old Provider Active
- **Trigger**: New provider fails to initialize after switch
- **Behavior**: Active provider remains unchanged
- **Error Handling**: Initialization error logged and reported
- **User Experience**: Switch operation fails gracefully
- **State Consistency**: Settings remain consistent with active provider

### 5.4 Event Emission Failure → Log but Continue
- **Trigger**: Event listener throws exception during notification
- **Behavior**: Exception caught, logged, and operation continues
- **Service Integrity**: Settings service remains operational
- **Other Listeners**: Remaining listeners still receive notifications
- **Error Recovery**: Faulty listeners removed from future notifications

### 5.5 Schema Migration Failure → Backup and Reset
- **Trigger**: Settings file format upgrade fails
- **Behavior**: Create backup of current settings, load defaults
- **User Notification**: Migration failure reported with backup location
- **Data Preservation**: Original settings preserved for manual recovery
- **Service Continuity**: Service continues with default settings

## 6. Performance Characteristics

### 6.1 Memory Access Patterns
- Settings stored in single in-memory object for O(1) access
- Provider-specific settings indexed by provider name
- No deep object traversal required for common operations
- Memory footprint scales linearly with provider count

### 6.2 File System Optimization
- Atomic file writes using temporary files and rename
- Minimal file I/O through batched write operations
- File watching for external settings file modifications
- Lazy loading of settings schemas and validators

### 6.3 Event System Performance
- Asynchronous event emission prevents blocking operations
- Event listener errors isolated to prevent cascading failures
- Minimal event payload to reduce serialization overhead
- Event queuing for high-frequency update scenarios

### 6.4 Concurrency Considerations
- Single-threaded service with operation queuing
- No locks required due to Node.js event loop model
- Atomic operations prevent race conditions
- Provider updates processed asynchronously to avoid blocking
