# Settings Centralization Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan implements a centralized settings service to solve the multi-source-of-truth problem where settings are scattered across different components, causing synchronization issues.

## Key Components

1. **SettingsService**: Central service managing all settings operations
2. **SettingsRepository**: Persistence layer for file system operations  
3. **Event System**: Notifies consumers of settings changes
4. **Provider Integration**: Updates provider instances on changes

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Analysis & Design (01-02)
- Domain model analysis
- Pseudocode development

### Phase 2: Settings Service (03-05)
- Stub implementation
- TDD with behavioral tests
- Full implementation

### Phase 3: Settings Repository (06-08)
- Stub implementation
- TDD with behavioral tests
- Full implementation

### Phase 4: Event System (09-11)
- Stub implementation
- TDD with behavioral tests
- Full implementation

### Phase 5: Provider Integration (12-14)
- Stub implementation
- TDD with behavioral tests
- Full implementation

### Phase 6: Migration & Cleanup (15-17)
- Migrate existing code
- Remove old implementations
- Integration testing

## Success Criteria

- All settings operations go through central service
- No stale data in UI commands like /diagnostics
- Provider instances auto-update on settings changes
- 100% behavioral test coverage
- Zero breaking changes to existing functionality
