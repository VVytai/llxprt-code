# Phase 10: Integration Analysis and Planning

## Goal
Map all integration points and create detailed wiring plan for connecting SettingsService as the runtime coordinator.

## Context
The SettingsService exists but is not integrated. This phase analyzes how to wire it into the existing system without breaking functionality.

## Tasks

1. **Map Config Class Integration Points**
   - List all ephemeralSettings access methods
   - Document all getter/setter patterns
   - Identify initialization sequence

2. **Analyze Provider Integration**
   - Map provider-specific settings
   - Document model parameter handling
   - Identify API key management patterns

3. **Profile System Analysis**
   - Document save/load flows
   - Map settings that go into profiles
   - Identify profile application sequence

4. **Command Integration Mapping**
   - List all commands that access settings
   - Document current access patterns
   - Identify modification points

5. **Create Compatibility Strategy**
   - Design backward-compatible API
   - Plan incremental migration
   - Document deprecation path

## Deliverables

- `integration-map.md` showing all touchpoints
- `compatibility-layer.md` design document
- Risk assessment for each integration point

## Success Criteria

- Complete understanding of all integration points
- Clear migration path defined
- No breaking changes identified
- Compatibility layer designed
