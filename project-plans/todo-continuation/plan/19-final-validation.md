# Phase 19: Final Validation

## Objective

Comprehensive validation of the entire todo continuation implementation.

## Validation Task

```bash
Task(
  description="Final implementation validation",
  prompt="Perform comprehensive validation of todo continuation implementation.

Validation checklist:

1. Code Quality:
   - Run: npm run lint
   - Run: npm run typecheck
   - Run: npm run format
   - Verify: No errors or warnings

2. Test Coverage:
   - Run: npm test -- --coverage
   - Verify: >90% coverage for new code
   - Check: All behavioral tests pass
   - Check: Integration tests pass
   - Check: E2E tests pass

3. Requirements Verification:
   For each requirement in specification.md:
   - [REQ-001.1] ✓ Stream completion detection works
   - [REQ-001.2] ✓ Active todo checking works
   - [REQ-001.3] ✓ Control return trigger works
   - [REQ-001.4] ✓ Setting respected
   - [REQ-002.1] ✓ Ephemeral prompts sent
   - [REQ-002.2] ✓ Task descriptions included
   - [REQ-002.3] ✓ YOLO mode variation works
   - [REQ-002.4] ✓ No history pollution
   - [REQ-003.1] ✓ todo_pause accepts reason
   - [REQ-003.2] ✓ Breaks loop without status change
   - [REQ-003.3] ✓ Displays reason to user
   - [REQ-003.4] ✓ Tool available during continuation
   - [REQ-004.1] ✓ Setting exists
   - [REQ-004.2] ✓ Defaults to true
   - [REQ-004.3] ✓ Changeable via /set
   - [REQ-004.4] ✓ Session-only persistence

4. Integration Points:
   - Verify: useGeminiStream integration active
   - Verify: TodoPause tool registered
   - Verify: Default setting works
   - Verify: No NotYetImplemented stubs remain

5. User Experience:
   - Test: Manual CLI usage
   - Create todos and trigger continuation
   - Use todo_pause tool
   - Toggle setting on/off
   - Verify smooth experience

Create validation report with all findings.",
  subagent_type="general-purpose"
)
```

## Expected Outcome

Complete validation report showing:
- All requirements implemented
- All tests passing
- Clean code quality
- Working user experience
