## Architecture Adaptations

### Settings Structure
The upstream code expected nested settings structure (e.g., `settings.security.folderTrust.featureEnabled`) but llxprt uses a flat structure. Adapted by:
- Changed to `settings.folderTrustFeature` and `settings.folderTrust`
- Changed `settings.ui.accessibility.screenReader` to `settings.accessibility.screenReader`

### Package Imports
Preserved llxprt's multi-provider architecture by:
- Keeping `@vybestack/llxprt-code-core` imports instead of `@google/gemini-cli-core`
- Added GEMINI_DIR export to core/utils/paths.ts as alias to LLXPRT_DIR for compatibility

### Function Signatures
Updated function calls to pass required Settings parameter:
- `isWorkspaceTrusted()` → `isWorkspaceTrusted(settings)`
- Updated all test files to pass mock settings objects

## Quality Checks

### Linting
✅ Passed - Fixed issues:
- Removed unused `migrateSettingsToV1` import
- Removed unnecessary eslint-disable comments from file-token-store.ts

### TypeScript
✅ Passed - Fixed issues:
- Added GEMINI_DIR export to core package
- Updated settings property paths to match flat structure
- Fixed all function signature mismatches

### Tests
⚠️ Most tests pass (2973 passed, 15 failed)
- Fixed file-token-store test context binding issue
- Remaining failures are in unrelated areas (process-utils)

### Build
✅ Passed - All packages built successfully

## Preserved llxprt Features

✅ Multi-provider architecture maintained
✅ Package naming (@vybestack/llxprt-code-core) preserved  
✅ Branding and naming kept as llxprt
✅ Extended authentication support intact
✅ Error handling patterns preserved

## Next Steps
