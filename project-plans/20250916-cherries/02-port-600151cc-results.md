# Cherry-pick Results: Commit 600151cc

## Summary
Successfully cherry-picked commit 600151cc from upstream gemini-cli repository.

**Commit**: `600151cc2 bug(core): Strip thoughts when loading history. (#7167)`
**Author**: joshualitt <joshualitt@google.com>
**Date**: Thu Aug 28 10:25:13 2025 -0700

## Changes Made

### 1. Cherry-pick Execution
```bash
git cherry-pick -x 600151cc
```

### 2. Conflict Resolution
Had one conflict in `packages/cli/src/ui/hooks/slashCommandProcessor.ts`:

**Conflict Details**:
- Upstream added `{ stripThoughts: true }` option to `setHistory()` call
- llxprt had refactored the code structure but was missing this option

**Resolution**:
- Preserved llxprt's refactored structure
- Added the `stripThoughts: true` option to the existing `setHistory()` call at line 472
- Maintained llxprt's comments about clearing UI history

### 3. TypeScript Issues Fixed
Fixed TypeScript compilation errors in `packages/cli/src/ui/hooks/useGeminiStream.ts`:

**Issues**:
- `ServerGeminiEventType` was an alias, needed to use `GeminiEventType` directly
- `UsageMetadata` case was added but enum references were incorrect

**Resolution**:
- Changed import from `GeminiEventType as ServerGeminiEventType` to just `GeminiEventType`
- Updated all switch case statements to use `GeminiEventType.` instead of `ServerGeminiEventType.`
- Rebuilt core package to ensure type definitions were up to date

## Quality Checks

### ✅ Lint
```bash
npm run lint
```
Status: **PASSED** (with 2 warnings in unrelated file)

### ✅ TypeCheck
```bash
npm run typecheck
```
Status: **PASSED**

### ⚠️ Tests
```bash
npm run test
```
Status: **PARTIAL** - 15 test failures, but they appear to be pre-existing issues not related to this cherry-pick:
- IDE process utils tests (2 failures)
- MCP file token store tests (13 failures)

The majority of tests pass (2973 passed out of 3043 total).

### ✅ Build
```bash
npm run build
```
Status: **PASSED**

## Files Modified

1. `packages/cli/src/ui/hooks/slashCommandProcessor.ts`
   - Added `{ stripThoughts: true }` option to `setHistory()` call

2. `packages/cli/src/ui/hooks/slashCommandProcessor.test.ts`
   - Tests updated by cherry-pick (no conflicts)

3. `packages/cli/src/ui/hooks/useGeminiStream.ts`
   - Fixed enum references from `ServerGeminiEventType` to `GeminiEventType`

## Preserved LLxprt Features

✅ Multi-provider architecture maintained
✅ Package naming kept as `@vybestack/llxprt-code-core`
✅ llxprt branding preserved
✅ Extended authentication support intact
✅ Error handling patterns maintained

## Conclusion

The cherry-pick was successful. The "strip thoughts" feature has been integrated into llxprt while preserving all existing multi-provider architecture and unique features. The code compiles, builds successfully, and the majority of tests pass. The test failures appear to be pre-existing issues unrelated to this cherry-pick.
