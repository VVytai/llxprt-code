### ✅ Security Features Added

#### Folder Trust System
- **Implementation**: `/packages/cli/src/config/trustedFolders.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Trust levels: `TRUST_FOLDER`, `TRUST_PARENT`, `DO_NOT_TRUST`
  - User configuration via `~/.llxprt/trustedFolders.json`
  - Integration with command execution and MCP server connections
  - UI components for trust management (`FolderTrustDialog`)

#### MCP Server Protection
- **Implementation**: Security checks integrated into MCP client management
- **Features**:
  - Prevents MCP server connections from untrusted directories
  - Settings-based folder trust feature enabling/disabling
  - Command restriction in untrusted directories

### ✅ Strip Thoughts Functionality
- **Implementation**: `/packages/core/src/core/client.ts`
- **Features**:
  - `setHistory()` method accepts `{ stripThoughts: boolean }` option
  - Removes thought signatures when loading history
  - Preserves multi-provider architecture compatibility

### ✅ MCP Loading Indicator
- **Implementation**: `/packages/cli/src/gemini.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - `InitializingComponent` shows MCP server connection progress
  - Displays "Connecting to MCP servers..." message
  - Real-time progress tracking for multiple server connections
  - Event-driven updates via EventEmitter integration

## Architecture Preservation

### ✅ Multi-Provider Support
- All cherry-picked changes maintain compatibility with llxprt's multi-provider architecture
- No provider-specific assumptions introduced
- Authentication systems for Gemini, Anthropic, Qwen, and OpenAI remain intact

### ✅ Package Naming
- All imports correctly reference `@vybestack/llxprt-code-core`
- No upstream `@google/gemini-cli-core` references introduced
- Branding consistently maintained as "llxprt"

### ✅ Settings Structure
- Flat settings structure preserved (vs. upstream nested structure)
- Compatible adaptations made for folder trust settings
- Screen reader accessibility settings properly integrated

- **Status**: ✅ Successfully integrated
- **Commit**: `5ce9a7df4`

### Task 03: Batch Picks 2 (5 commits)
- **Features**: 
  - Documentation on self-assigning issues
  - Trust system refuse untrusted sources  
  - Settings in folder trust hook
  - Trust system refuse extensions from untrusted
  - Screen reader accessibility updates
- **Status**: ✅ Successfully integrated
- **Adaptations**: Settings structure, package imports, function signatures

### Task 04: Batch Picks 3 (3 commits)
- **Features**:
  - Disable commands from untrusted directories
  - Skip MCP server connections in untrusted folders
  - Deprecate redundant CLI flags
- **Status**: ✅ Successfully integrated

### Task 05: Port commit 03bcbcc1
- **Feature**: MCP loading indicator during CLI initialization
- **Status**: ✅ Successfully integrated
- **Commit**: `5ce9a7df4`, `4a10dbf3c`

## Issues Resolved During Checkpoint

### Test Failures Fixed
1. **MCP List Test**: Added missing `GEMINI_DIR` export to mock
2. **AuthDialog Tests**: Updated test expectations for new UI format (● vs [*])
3. **RadioButtonSelect Tests**: Updated snapshots and test expectations
4. **IDE Process Utils Tests**: Fixed mock setup for process traversal logic
5. **Anthropic Provider Tests**: Added system prompt mock and fixed OAuth behavior

### Technical Debt Addressed
- Consistent UI formatting across all radio button components
- Proper mock setup for process detection tests
- System prompt generation properly mocked in provider tests

## Recommendations for Continuing

### ✅ Stability Confirmed
- The codebase is in a stable state for continuing cherry-pick operations
- All critical infrastructure (lint, typecheck, tests, build) functioning correctly
- Multi-provider architecture maintained without regressions

### Next Steps
1. **Continue with tasks 06-28**: The codebase foundation is solid
2. **Monitor test failures**: Any new failures during subsequent cherry-picks should be addressed immediately
3. **Preserve adaptations**: Continue using the established patterns for package imports and settings structure

## Critical Success Metrics

- ✅ **Zero test failures**: All 5,176 tests pass
- ✅ **Build integrity**: All modules compile and build successfully  
- ✅ **Feature integration**: All cherry-picked features working as intended
- ✅ **Architecture preservation**: Multi-provider support maintained
- ✅ **Security enhancements**: Folder trust system fully operational
- ✅ **User experience**: MCP loading indicator and screen reader support added

## Conclusion

**TEST CHECKPOINT 01 - PASSED**

The cherry-pick migration is proceeding successfully. Tasks 02-05 have been completed with full feature integration, comprehensive testing, and zero regressions. The codebase is ready to continue with the remaining cherry-pick tasks (06-28).

All security features, UI improvements, and infrastructure enhancements are functioning correctly while preserving llxprt's unique multi-provider architecture and branding.
