# Task 02: Verify OAuth MCP Storage Changes

## Task Description
Verify that the OAuth MCP storage changes were successfully applied and all functionality works correctly.

## Verification Steps

### 1. Confirm Commit Applied
```bash
# Check the commit is in the log
git log --oneline -1 | grep -i "oauth"

# Verify the correct files were modified
git diff HEAD~1 --name-only | grep -E "(oauth|mcp)"
```

### 2. Code Structure Verification

#### Check Instance-based Implementation:
```bash
# Verify static methods are removed
grep -r "static.*MCPOAuthTokenStorage" packages/core/src/mcp/ || echo "✓ No static methods found"

# Verify constructor exists
grep -r "constructor.*MCPOAuthTokenStorage" packages/core/src/mcp/
```

#### Check Usage Updates:
```bash
# Find all instantiations of MCPOAuthTokenStorage
grep -r "new MCPOAuthTokenStorage" packages/

# Verify no static calls remain
grep -r "MCPOAuthTokenStorage\." packages/ | grep -v "new MCPOAuthTokenStorage"
```

### 3. Test OAuth Functionality

#### Unit Tests:
```bash
# Run OAuth-specific tests
npm test -- --grep "oauth|OAuth|MCP.*token"

# Run MCP client tests
npm test -- --grep "mcp-client|MCPClient"
```

#### Manual Testing:
1. Configure an MCP server that requires OAuth
2. Verify OAuth flow works correctly
3. Configure a second MCP server with different OAuth
4. Verify tokens are isolated between servers

### 4. Security Verification

```bash
# Check token storage isolation
# Tokens should be stored per-server, not globally

# Verify file permissions on token storage
ls -la ~/.llxprt/mcp-oauth-tokens/ 2>/dev/null || echo "Check token storage location"
```

### 5. Full Test Suite
```bash
# Complete verification
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test
npm run build
```

### 6. Multi-Provider Compatibility

Test that OAuth changes work with different providers:
```bash
# Test with Gemini provider
LLXPRT_PROVIDER=gemini npm test -- --grep "mcp"

# Test with OpenAI provider (if applicable)
LLXPRT_PROVIDER=openai npm test -- --grep "mcp"
```

## Expected Results

### Code Structure:
- ✅ MCPOAuthTokenStorage is now instance-based
- ✅ No static method calls remain
- ✅ Each MCP server can have its own storage instance

### Functionality:
- ✅ MCP servers with OAuth work correctly
- ✅ Multiple MCP servers can have different OAuth contexts
- ✅ Tokens are properly isolated between servers

### Tests:
- ✅ All OAuth-related tests pass
- ✅ MCP client tests pass
- ✅ Full test suite passes

## Success Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Instance-based MCPOAuthTokenStorage confirmed
- [ ] All static references removed
- [ ] OAuth flow works for single MCP server
- [ ] OAuth isolation works for multiple MCP servers
- [ ] Token storage is properly isolated
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No security regressions
- [ ] Multi-provider compatibility maintained

## Troubleshooting

### If Tests Fail:
1. Check for missed static method conversions
2. Verify all instantiations pass correct parameters
3. Check token storage file paths and permissions

### If OAuth Flow Breaks:
1. Verify storage instance is created correctly
2. Check server name is passed to constructor
3. Verify token save/load methods work with instances

## Notes

The instance-based approach provides better security isolation and allows for more flexible OAuth management across multiple MCP servers. This is particularly important when different MCP servers require different OAuth providers or credentials.
