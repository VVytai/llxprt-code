# Plan: Token Tracking Enhancement

Plan ID: PLAN-20250113-TOKENTRACKING
Generated: 2025-01-13
Total Phases: 16
Requirements: REQ-001 (all sub-requirements)

## Overview

This plan will implement comprehensive token usage tracking in LLxprt Code, including tokens per minute, cumulative session token usage, 429 wait time tracking, and requests per minute. The tracking system will be integrated into the UI footer, diagnostics command, and session summary dialog.

## Implementation Approach

1. ProviderPerformanceTracker Enhancement (Phases 03-05)
   - Add TPM tracking capabilities
   - Add 429 wait time tracking
   - Add RPM tracking

2. ProviderManager Enhancement (Phases 06-08)
   - Add session token accumulation functionality

3. UI Integration (Phases 09-11)
   - Modify Footer component to display TPM and session tokens
   - Update diagnostics command with token metrics
   - Update session summary with token metrics

4. Integration and Testing (Phases 12-16)
   - Connect all components
   - Verify functionality
   - Run end-to-end tests
   - Handle migration and deprecation of old tracking methods

## Success Criteria

- TPM tracking works correctly and excludes non-provider time
- 429 wait times are properly captured and included in TPM calculations
- Session token counts are accurately accumulated
- RPM tracking functions independently
- UI components display token metrics responsively
- All new code follows TDD principles with behavioral tests
- Implementation integrates properly with existing system
