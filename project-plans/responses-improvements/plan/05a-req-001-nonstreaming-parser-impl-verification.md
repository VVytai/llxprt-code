# 05a – REQ-001 Non-Streaming Parser – Implementation Verification

Goal
- Verify implementation of parseResponsesNonStreaming satisfies all behavioral tests and requirements [REQ-001.1..REQ-001.4].

Inputs
- ../specification.md [REQ-001]
- ../analysis/pseudocode/001-parse-responses-non-streaming.md
- test/providers/openai/parseResponsesNonStreaming.spec.ts
- ../../docs/RULES.md

Verification Checks
- [Tests Pass] All tests in parseResponsesNonStreaming.spec.ts pass without modification
- [Behavioral Coverage] Tests cover text parsing, function_call mapping, usage emission, and edge cases
- [Strict TS] No any, no type assertions; tsconfig strict passes
- [No Console] No console.log/TODO in source
- [Mutation Score] ≥80% (if included in project)
- [Coverage] >90% lines/functions on changed file(s)

Procedure
1) Run unit tests for the module
2) Run full suite to detect regressions in Responses path
3) Run coverage and (optional) mutation tests
4) Grep for debug code/TODOs

Acceptance Criteria
- PASS when all checks succeed
- FAIL with specific diffs if tests modified or requirements unmet

TODOLIST
- [ ] Run unit tests for non-streaming parser
- [ ] Confirm behavioral assertions and @requirement tags
- [ ] Run coverage and mutation testing where configured
- [ ] Verify no debug logs/TODOs present
- [ ] Mark REQ-001 planning complete
