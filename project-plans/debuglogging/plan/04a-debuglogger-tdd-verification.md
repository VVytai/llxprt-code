# Phase 04a: DebugLogger TDD Verification

## Phase ID
`PLAN-20250120-DEBUGLOGGING.P04a`

## Prerequisites
- Phase 04 executed
- Test file created

## Verification Checklist

### Test Quality
- [ ] Tests expect real behavior, not NotYetImplemented
- [ ] No reverse testing (no expect.toThrow('NotYetImplemented'))
- [ ] Behavioral assertions present (toBe, toEqual)
- [ ] 30% property-based tests included

### Test Coverage
- [ ] Lazy evaluation tested
- [ ] Namespace matching tested
- [ ] Zero overhead tested
- [ ] Sensitive data redaction tested
- [ ] All public methods covered

### Test Execution
```bash
# Tests exist and fail naturally
npm test DebugLogger
# PASS: Tests fail with real errors, not NotYetImplemented catches

# Check for reverse testing
grep -r "toThrow.*NotYetImplemented" packages/core/src/debug/
# PASS: No results

# Property test percentage
grep -c "it.prop" packages/core/src/debug/*.test.ts
# PASS: At least 30% of tests
```

## Status: PASS/FAIL

Proceed to Phase 05 only if all checks pass.
