# Phase 01: Domain Analysis

## Phase ID
`PLAN-20250120-DEBUGLOGGING.P01`

## Prerequisites
- specification.md exists and is complete

## Task Description

Analyze the debug logging domain to understand:
- Current debug patterns in the codebase
- Integration requirements with existing systems
- Performance implications
- Security considerations

## Deliverables

Created: `analysis/domain-model.md`

Key insights:
- Configuration hierarchy with 5 levels of precedence
- Lazy evaluation critical for performance
- File output with rotation and retention
- Namespace-based filtering like `debug` package
- Security: Must redact sensitive data

## Verification

✅ Domain model covers all REQ tags
✅ Edge cases identified
✅ Business rules defined
✅ Integration points mapped
