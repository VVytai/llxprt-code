# Task 5: Responsive UI Implementation Verification

## Context

This is a verification task to be executed by a different subagent after Tasks 1-4 are complete. The goal is to independently verify that the responsive UI implementation meets all requirements and maintains quality standards.

## Requirements

1. Verify responsive infrastructure works correctly
2. Confirm all components adapt properly
3. Test user experience at all breakpoints
4. Ensure no functionality is lost
5. Validate all RULES.md standards are followed

## Verification Steps

### 1. Infrastructure Verification

Check responsive utilities:
- [ ] `BREAKPOINTS` constants defined correctly
- [ ] `useResponsive` hook works at all widths
- [ ] Truncation utilities handle edge cases
- [ ] Testing utilities enable proper testing

Test manually:
```bash
# Resize terminal to various widths and verify:
# - 60 columns (very narrow)
# - 79 columns (just under narrow)
# - 80 columns (narrow boundary)
# - 100 columns (standard)
# - 120 columns (standard boundary)
# - 160+ columns (wide)
```

### 2. Component Behavior Verification

#### TodoPanel
- [ ] NARROW: Shows task list with status only
- [ ] STANDARD: Adds progress indicators
- [ ] WIDE: Full layout with all details
- [ ] Task information never lost, only reformatted

#### Provider/Model Dialogs
- [ ] NARROW: Single column with search
- [ ] STANDARD: 2-3 column grid
- [ ] WIDE: 4+ column grid
- [ ] Search appears when appropriate
- [ ] Selection works at all widths

#### Footer
- [ ] NARROW: Essential info only (mem, ctx, branch)
- [ ] STANDARD: Adds model information
- [ ] WIDE: Full details with timestamps
- [ ] Progressive enhancement working

#### Tool Confirmations
- [ ] Summary always visible
- [ ] 'd' key toggles details
- [ ] Details formatting appropriate for width

### 3. User Experience Testing

Manual testing checklist:
- [ ] Resize terminal while app is running
- [ ] All transitions smooth (no jumpy layouts)
- [ ] Text truncation readable and logical
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling needed
- [ ] Keyboard navigation preserved

### 4. Test Quality Verification

Review test files:
- [ ] Tests are behavioral, not structural
- [ ] All breakpoints have test coverage
- [ ] Edge cases tested (very narrow, very wide)
- [ ] No mocking of component internals

Example of good test:
```typescript
// GOOD: Tests actual behavior
expect(result.getByText('Todo (2/5):')).toBeInTheDocument();

// BAD: Tests implementation
expect(component.state.layout).toBe('narrow');
```

### 5. Performance Verification

- [ ] No excessive re-renders on resize
- [ ] Responsive calculations are efficient
- [ ] No memory leaks from resize listeners
- [ ] App remains responsive during resize

### 6. RULES.md Compliance Audit

From @llxprt-code/docs/RULES.md:
- [ ] **No `any` types**: Check all new code
- [ ] **Error handling**: Graceful width edge cases
- [ ] **No console.log**: Remove debug statements
- [ ] **Test quality**: Behavioral tests only
- [ ] **Code organization**: Logical file structure

## Verification Report Template

```markdown
## Responsive UI Implementation Verification

### Infrastructure ✓/✗
- Breakpoint system working
- Utilities handle all cases
- Hook provides clean API
- Testing utilities functional

### Component Adaptations ✓/✗
- TodoPanel: [Narrow/Standard/Wide behavior]
- Dialogs: [Grid/List transitions]
- Footer: [Progressive detail]
- Tools: [Detail toggle working]

### User Experience ✓/✗
- Smooth resize behavior
- No information loss
- Readable truncation
- Keyboard navigation intact

### Code Quality ✓/✗
- All tests behavioral
- Performance acceptable
- RULES.md compliant
- Clean implementation

## Test Commands

Run these to verify:
```bash
# All tests pass
npm test -- --grep "responsive"

# No type errors
npm run typecheck

# No lint issues  
npm run lint

# Proper formatting
npm run format
```

## Failure Criteria

Fail if:
1. Any component breaks at specific widths
2. Information is lost rather than reformatted
3. Tests are structural rather than behavioral
4. Performance degrades significantly
5. RULES.md violations present

## Success Criteria

Pass when:
1. All components adapt smoothly
2. User experience is good at all widths
3. Tests prove behavior correctly
4. Performance remains excellent
5. Code meets all quality standards

## Edge Cases to Verify

- Terminal width of 40 columns
- Terminal width of 300 columns  
- Rapid resize events
- Components with very long text
- Empty states at all widths
