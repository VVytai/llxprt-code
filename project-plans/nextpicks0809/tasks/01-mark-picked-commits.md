# Task 1: Mark Picked Commits

## Objective
Mark upstream commits as picked that we've already reimplemented with our privacy-first approach.

## Commits to Mark

### 1. `60bde58f` - LoggingContentGenerator
```bash
git merge -s ours --no-ff 60bde58f -m "Mark upstream LoggingContentGenerator (60bde58f) as picked

This has been reimplemented as LoggingProviderWrapper in llxprt.

Our implementation:
- Works with all providers (not just Gemini)
- Transparent passthrough wrapper pattern
- Local-only logging with privacy controls
- No external data transmission"
```

### 2. `bae922a6` - Move logging into CodeAssistServer
```bash
git merge -s ours --no-ff bae922a6 -m "Mark upstream CodeAssistServer logging (bae922a6) as picked

This has been reimplemented in llxprt with privacy-first logging.

Our implementation:
- Conversation logging via /logging command
- Local storage in ~/.llxprt/conversations/
- Granular privacy controls
- Multi-provider support"
```

### 3. `e50d886b` - Telemetry docs (after creating our docs)
```bash
git merge -s ours --no-ff e50d886b -m "Mark upstream telemetry docs (e50d886b) as picked

Created llxprt-specific privacy documentation.

Our documentation:
- Privacy-first telemetry approach
- Local-only data storage
- /logging command reference
- No external data transmission"
```

### 4. `5ab184fc` - Git telemetry (after implementing)
```bash
git merge -s ours --no-ff 5ab184fc -m "Mark upstream git telemetry (5ab184fc) as picked

Reimplemented with privacy-first approach.

Our implementation:
- Lines added/removed tracked locally only
- Stored in conversation logs when enabled
- Simple on/off control
- No external transmission"
```

## Steps
