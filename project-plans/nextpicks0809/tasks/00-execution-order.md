# Execution Order and Task Assignment

## Phase 1: Mark Already Reimplemented (Direct execution)
**Execute immediately - no subagent needed**

1. Mark `60bde58f` (LoggingContentGenerator) as picked
2. Mark `bae922a6` (CodeAssistServer logging) as picked

Commands:
```bash
# Ensure we're on the right branch
git status

# Mark LoggingContentGenerator as picked
git merge -s ours --no-ff 60bde58f -m "Mark upstream LoggingContentGenerator (60bde58f) as picked

This has been reimplemented as LoggingProviderWrapper in llxprt.

Our implementation:
- Works with all providers (not just Gemini)
- Transparent passthrough wrapper pattern
- Local-only logging with privacy controls
- No external data transmission"

# Mark CodeAssistServer logging as picked
git merge -s ours --no-ff bae922a6 -m "Mark upstream CodeAssistServer logging (bae922a6) as picked

This has been reimplemented in llxprt with privacy-first logging.

Our implementation:
- Conversation logging via /logging command
- Local storage in ~/.llxprt/conversations/
- Granular privacy controls
- Multi-provider support"
```

## Phase 2: Documentation (typescript-coder subagent)
**Task**: `02-telemetry-documentation.md`

Create privacy-first telemetry documentation:
- Create `docs/telemetry-privacy.md`
- Document /logging command
- Explain privacy approach
- Include configuration examples

## Phase 3: Git Stats Tests (typescript-code-reviewer subagent)
**Task**: `03-git-stats-behavioral-tests.md`

Write behavioral tests FIRST:
- Privacy-first behavior tests
- Statistics calculation tests  
- Integration tests
- Simple on/off control tests

## Phase 4: Git Stats Implementation (typescript-coder subagent)
**Task**: `04-git-stats-implementation.md`

Implement git statistics tracking:
- Create GitStatsTracker class
- Integrate with edit/write tools
- Include in conversation logs
- Display in /logging show

## Phase 5: Mark Documentation and Stats as Picked (Direct execution)
**Execute after Phase 2 and 4 complete**

```bash
# Mark telemetry docs as picked (after creating our docs)
git merge -s ours --no-ff e50d886b -m "Mark upstream telemetry docs (e50d886b) as picked

Created llxprt-specific privacy documentation in docs/telemetry-privacy.md

Our documentation:
- Privacy-first telemetry approach
- Local-only data storage
- /logging command reference
- No external data transmission"

# Mark git stats as picked (after implementation)
git merge -s ours --no-ff 5ab184fc -m "Mark upstream git telemetry (5ab184fc) as picked

Reimplemented with privacy-first approach.

Our implementation:
- Lines added/removed tracked locally only
- Stored in conversation logs when enabled
- Simple on/off control
- No external transmission"
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All upstream commits marked as picked
- [ ] Documentation created and comprehensive
- [ ] Git stats tests written and passing
- [ ] Git stats implementation complete
- [ ] No external data transmission
- [ ] Everything integrated with existing logging system

## Notes
- Follow test-first development for git stats
- Maintain privacy-first approach throughout
- Keep controls simple (on/off only)
- Ensure multi-provider compatibility
