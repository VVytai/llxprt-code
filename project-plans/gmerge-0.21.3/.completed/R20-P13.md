# R20-P13 — Verifier: MCP status and /mcp resource visibility

Verdict: PASS

Evidence summary:
- Prerequisite marker exists: `project-plans/gmerge-0.21.3/.completed/R20-P12.md`.
- Implementation inspection (`packages/cli/src/ui/commands/mcpCommand.ts`) confirms MCP resources are integrated into `/mcp` status output:
  - Reads resources via `config.getResourceRegistry()?.getAllResources?.()`.
  - Filters resources by `serverName`.
  - Includes resource counts in Ready summary (`resource`/`resources`).
  - Renders a `Resources:` section listing resource name and URI.
  - Extends cached-ready behavior to include resources when determining displayed READY state.
  - Updates empty fallback to `No tools, prompts, or resources available`.
- Test inspection (`packages/cli/src/ui/commands/mcpCommand.test.ts`) confirms explicit coverage:
  - Test `should include resource counts and resource names in MCP status output` validates:
    - summary count strings including resources,
    - `Resources:` heading,
    - resource names and URIs for multiple servers.
  - Existing MCP tests remain comprehensive for statuses, tips, desc/nodesc/schema, blocked servers, auth, and refresh, with no obvious regression indicators in test expectations.
