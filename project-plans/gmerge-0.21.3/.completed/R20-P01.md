# R20-P01 — Verify P00 (Verifier)

- Timestamp (UTC): 2026-02-21T13:05:30Z
- Phase: P01 (Verifier)
- Plan: `project-plans/gmerge-0.21.3/560550f5df78-plan.md`
- Verdict: **PASS**

## Criteria check (from Phase P01)

1. `.completed/R20-P00.md` exists and includes upstream mapping evidence
   - **PASS**
   - Evidence: Contains explicit `git show --name-status 560550f5df78` command and full file list from commit `560550f5df78a11f96464c91d358a8e0fbeb32c9`.

2. `.completed/R20-P00.md` includes R20-only scope statement
   - **PASS**
   - Evidence: "Scope is locked to **R20 MCP Resources only**... No non-R20 expansion is authorized in this phase."

3. `.completed/R20-P00.md` includes in-scope / out-of-scope boundaries
   - **PASS**
   - Evidence: Dedicated "Gap matrix" section with "In scope (R20)" and "Out of scope (explicit)" lists.

4. No unauthorized expansion in P00 content
   - **PASS**
   - Evidence: P00 content is prerequisite/scope mapping only; no implementation claims or non-R20 feature commitments.

5. Confirm no code changes occurred in P00 (only plan/marker artifacts acceptable)
   - **PASS**
   - Evidence:
     - `git status --porcelain` output shows only:
       - `?? project-plans/gmerge-0.21.3/.completed/R20-P00.md`
       - `?? project-plans/gmerge-0.21.3/.completed/R20-P01.md`
     - No source-code paths under `packages/` or `docs/` are modified.

## Verifier command evidence

Command run:

    git status --porcelain

Observed output:

    ?? project-plans/gmerge-0.21.3/.completed/R20-P00.md
    ?? project-plans/gmerge-0.21.3/.completed/R20-P01.md

## Conclusion
Phase P00 is complete, constrained, and executable per P01 criteria. No code changes were introduced during P00; only plan-local completion markers are present.
