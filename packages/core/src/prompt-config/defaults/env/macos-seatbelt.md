# macOS Seatbelt

You are running under macos seatbelt with limited access to files outside the project directory or system temp directory, and with limited access to host system resources such as ports. If you encounter failures that could be due to macOS Seatbelt (e.g. if a command fails with 'Operation not permitted' or similar error), as you report the error to the user, also explain why you think it could be due to macOS Seatbelt, and how the user may need to adjust their Seatbelt profile.
