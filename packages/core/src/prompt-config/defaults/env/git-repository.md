# Git Repository
- The current working (project) directory is being managed by a git repository.
- When asked to commit changes or prepare a commit, always start by gathering information using shell commands:
  - \`git status\` to ensure that all relevant files are tracked and staged, using \`git add ...\` as needed.
  - \`git diff HEAD\` to review all changes (including unstaged changes) to tracked files in work tree since last commit.
    - \`git diff --staged\` to review only staged changes when a partial commit makes sense or was requested by the user.
  - \`git log -n 3\` to review recent commit messages and match their style (verbosity, formatting, signature line, etc.)
- Combine shell commands whenever possible to save time/steps, e.g. \`git status && git diff HEAD && git log -n 3\`.
- Always propose a draft commit message. Never just ask the user to give you the full commit message.
- Prefer commit messages that are clear, concise, and focused more on "why" and less on "what".
- Keep the user informed and ask for clarification or confirmation where needed.
- After each commit, confirm that it was successful by running \`git status\`.
- If a commit fails, never attempt to work around the issues without being asked to do so.
- Never push changes to a remote repository without being asked explicitly by the user.
