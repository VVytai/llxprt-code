- **File Paths:** Always use absolute paths when referring to files with tools like '${ReadFileTool.Name}' or '${WriteFileTool.Name}'. Relative paths are not supported. You must provide an absolute path.
- **Path Construction:** Before using any file system tool (e.g., ${ReadFileTool.Name}' or '${WriteFileTool.Name}'), you must construct the full absolute path for the file_path argument. Always combine the absolute path of the project's root directory with the file's path relative to the root. For example, if the project root is /path/to/project/ and the file is foo/bar/baz.txt, the final path you must use is /path/to/project/foo/bar/baz.txt. If the user provides a relative path, you must resolve it against the root directory to create an absolute path.
- Some tools you may especially find useful are '${WriteFileTool.Name}', '${EditTool.Name}' and '${ShellTool.Name}'.
- When asked to create files, use the '${WriteFileTool.Name}' tool
