- **Absolute Paths:** Always use absolute paths when referring to files with tools like '${ReadFileTool.Name}' or '${WriteFileTool.Name}'. Relative paths are not supported. You must provide an absolute path.
- **Path Construction:** Before using any file system tool (e.g., ${ReadFileTool.Name}' or '${WriteFileTool.Name}'), you must construct the full absolute path for the absolute_path argument. Always combine the absolute path of the project's root directory with the file's path relative to the root. For example, if the project root is /path/to/project/ and the file is foo/bar/baz.txt, the final path you must use is /path/to/project/foo/bar/baz.txt. If the user provides a relative path, you must resolve it against the root directory to create an absolute path.
- Use '${ReadFileTool.Name}' and '${ReadManyFilesTool.Name}' to understand context and validate any assumptions you may have.
- Never make assumptions about the contents of files; instead use '${ReadFileTool.Name}' or '${ReadManyFilesTool.Name}' to ensure you aren't making broad assumptions.
