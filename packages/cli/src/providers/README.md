# Provider Integration Status

## Phase 07 - Integrate ProviderManager into CLI

### Completed:

1. ✅ Created ProviderManager singleton instance (`providerManagerInstance.ts`)
2. ✅ Implemented `/provider` command in `slashCommandProcessor.ts`
   - Lists available providers
   - Switches between providers
3. ✅ Enhanced `/model` command to be provider-aware
   - Lists models for current provider when no argument given
   - Switches models within the active provider
4. ✅ Added `setModel` and `getCurrentModel` methods to IProvider interface
5. ✅ Implemented model switching in OpenAIProvider

### TODO - Chat Loop Integration:

The main chat loop is currently tightly coupled to the Gemini client. To fully integrate providers:

1. **Modify `useGeminiStream.ts`**: Replace calls to `geminiClient.sendMessageStream()` with provider-based calls
2. **Update `GeminiClient` class**: Either refactor to use ProviderManager or create a new abstraction
3. **Adapt streaming protocol**: Convert provider-specific streaming formats to the UI's expected format
4. **Update tool handling**: Ensure tool calls work across different providers

### Current State:

- `/provider` command works for listing and switching providers
- `/model` command works for listing and switching models within providers
- OpenAI provider is initialized if `~/.openai_key` exists
- Chat completion still uses Gemini (not yet integrated with ProviderManager)

### Next Steps:

To complete the integration, the core chat loop needs to be refactored to use ProviderManager instead of the Gemini-specific client. This is a more complex task that requires careful consideration of:

- Streaming format differences between providers
- Tool call format differences
- Error handling across providers
- Maintaining backward compatibility with existing Gemini functionality
